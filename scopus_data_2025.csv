Acceptance sampling is one of the two primary approaches for ensuring quality, which is used in statistical process control for attributes inspection of the product. In acceptance sampling based on predetermined acceptance criteria for inspection the lot is either accepted or not accepted. This research introduces a Bayesian double group sampling plan (BDGSP) for estimating average number of nonconforming products. Based on acceptance criteria the Poisson distribution is used to construct the likelihood function for both nonconforming and conforming products. To calculate the average probability of acceptance, the gamma distribution is used as a suitable prior distribution of the Poisson distribution. For various suggested producer’s and consumer’s risk levels four distinct quality regions are calculated. The producer’s risk is related to acceptable quality level and consumer’s risk is related to and limiting quality level. Operating characteristic curves are utilized to track the effects of changes in the values of the specified parameters. The applicability of the proposed plan for current industrial strategies is demonstrated using a real dataset.","Multidisciplinary","Guangdong University of Petrochemical Technology","Maoming","China"

It is not easy for government organizations, especially local governments, to directly implement e-government services in full. One solution that is considered appropriate and can solve these problems is the application of cloud computing to support e-government services in local governments. The advantage of cloud computing for e-government is that it can increase security. In contrast, cloud-based storage can be valuable because data stored in cloud computing is guaranteed secure and various regulations and standards of information safety practices. We propose a systematic literature review approach to analyze trends in studies on cloud computing of e-government. This research is a type of descriptive qualitative research using a bibliometric approach. To assess the trend of cloud computing in e-government, we use CiteSpace’s latest bibliometric software to achieve a comprehensive knowledge overview of cloud computing in e-government. The Findings of this paper reveal a dynamic scenario influenced by advancing technological progress and administrative priorities. Across the globe, governments are progressively acknowledging the capacity of cloud computing to improve the effectiveness, accessibility, and scalability of e-government services. Overall, challenges persist, spanning from concerns regarding data safekeeping and privacy, but it also signifies a strategic transition towards harnessing digital technologies to provide more agile, citizen-focused public services.","Software, Computer Networks and Communications","Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta | TPL Logistics Pvt Ltd","Yogyakarta | Karachi","Indonesia | Pakistan"

However, the effectiveness of this intervention in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment has not yet been definitively established through meta-analysis. In this meta-analysis, we aim to assess the effectiveness of creative arts therapy in the management of PTSD. Methods: We conducted systematic literature searches through electronic databases from the extended inception of each database to November 2023. We utilized the Cochrane risk of bias tool to evaluate the quality of evidence. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated as the effects of creative art therapy on the improvement of PTSD. Results: Seven controlled, comparative studies investigated the use of creative arts therapy in treating adults with PTSD. Meta-analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in PTSD symptoms following creative arts therapy (SMD = -1.98, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): -3.8 to -0.16, p < 0.03, I2 = 98%). Subgroup analysis indicates that drama therapy was notably effective, while music, art, and dance/movement therapies exhibited less pronounced effects. Conclusion: Despite the limitations, including a limited number of studies, participant size, study heterogeneity, and methodological quality, these results provide valuable understanding regarding the efficacy of creative arts therapies in treating PTSD and highlight the urgent need for additional research in this area.","Psychology (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Particularly in the realm of fashion design, style transfer techniques offer designers innovative tools to automatically generate diverse style designs, thereby enhancing creativity and diversity. However, existing style transfer methods still face challenges in balancing content preservation and style representation, as well as in computational efficiency. This study aims to explore a Neural Style Transfer (NST)-based model for fashion style transfer to address these issues and improve the efficiency and quality of fashion design. Methodology: The proposed network architecture consists of three convolutional layers and one deconvolutional layer, designed to efficiently extract and integrate spatial features of fashion elements. Subsequently, the Visual Geometry Group (VGG)-Garment network architecture is employed for feature extraction and style fusion, with optimization algorithms generating high-quality fashion design images. Additionally, by introducing four semantic loss functions—content loss, style loss, color loss, and contour loss—the model ensures the preservation of the original design content while flexibly incorporating other visual styles. Results: The experimental results demonstrate the following: (1) The proposed model excels in both style transfer effectiveness and computational efficiency. The style retention rate ranges from 82.11 % to 88.54 %. The content retention rate falls between 87.90 % and 92.56 %. These results indicate that the model effectively integrates diverse style elements while preserving the original design. (2) The proposed method outperforms three other models in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) across all six fashion styles. Notably, in the ""luxury"" style, the PSNR value of the proposed method reaches 32.01, significantly higher than that of other models. (3) In terms of computational efficiency, the model generates a style-transferred fashion design image in an average of 15.23 s. The storage footprint is 251.45 MB, and the computational resource utilization rate is 60.78 %. These results show a significant improvement over traditional method. Discussion: This study makes a significant contribution by proposing a model that enhances visual effects and design diversity. Additionally, it outperforms traditional methods in computational efficiency and resource utilization. This model provides a novel technical approach for the fashion design industry, effectively reducing design costs and enhancing the overall efficiency of the design process.","Software, Theoretical Computer Science, Computer Science Applications, Computational Theory and Mathematics","Xichang University | Universiti Utara Malaysia","Xichang | Sintok","China | Malaysia"

This study aimed to identify the factors influencing the intention to adopt blockchain in healthcare by focusing on healthcare providers. A theoretical model is proposed by integrating the Technological-Organizational-Environmental framework, Fit-Viability Model, and institutional theory. A quantitative approach was adopted and data were collected through an online survey of 199 hospitals to evaluate the model. The collected data were analysed using PLS-SEM. The results indicated that technology trust, information transparency, disintermediation, cost-effectiveness, top management support, organizational readiness, partner readiness, technology vendor support, fit, and viability significantly and positively influenced the intention to adopt blockchain-based Health Information Systems in hospitals. Conversely, coercive pressure from the government negatively affects adoption decisions. Moreover, the study found that the hospital ownership type did not moderate the relationship between the identified factors and blockchain adoption. This study provides valuable insights into the various factors that influence blockchain adoption in hospitals.

Compassion fatigue is described as a result in the form of behaviors and emotions resulting from learning of another person's traumatic event. Compassion fatigue is considered a 'cost of caring.' This study was a scoping literature review that aimed to identify what is known about compassion fatigue in helping professions. Methods: A systematic search was conducted on electronic databases, namely ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Taylor and Francis. Data analysis was conducted using PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Study results were mapped based on the following criteria: 1) conceptual analysis; 2) predictor factors; and 3) research progress. A total of 43 articles met the inclusion and eligibility criteria for further review in this scoping literature review. Results: The results showed that it is difficult to imagine how a conceptual model of compassion fatigue could be equally relevant and applicable to various helping professions. Factors that can influence compassion fatigue are divided into personal factors (professional factors and sociodemographic factors), such as resilience, burnout, moral courage, emotional control, mindfulness, work experience, professional competence, and professional efficacy, and work-related factors such as traumatic experiences, life disorders, number of patients treated, job satisfaction, emotional support, social support, and fluctuations in interactions with suffering patients. Research on compassion fatigue has developed a lot, especially in the health sector, especially nursing using experimental, cross-sectional, and literature review research methods. Conclusion: Further analysis is needed in developing a conceptual analysis of compassion fatigue that focuses on other fields of work more specifically and comprehensively by paying attention to, aspects, determinants, and validity of compassion fatigue symptoms.","Psychology (all)","Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris","Tanjong Malim","Malaysia"

Using the Panel ARDL method, the findings reveal that industrial output positively impacts life expectancy, highlighting the economic benefits of industrialization, such as improved healthcare access and job creation. Model 1's industrial output coefficient is 0.1542, while Model 2's is 0.2352, both models giving a p-value of 0.0000. However, this positive effect is significantly offset by coal consumption, which detracts from life expectancy due to environmental degradation and health hazards such as respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. This coefficient is 0.0722 (p-value: 0.0000) in Model 2 and 0.8457 (p-value: 0.0000) in Model 1. The study further shows that the interaction between industrial output and coal consumption exacerbates these adverse effects, underlining the critical need for sustainable industrial practices. Practical implications include the necessity for targeted green policies, such as phasing out coal subsidies, adopting renewable energy technologies, and implementing carbon taxation, to mitigate the detrimental health impacts of coal consumption while maintaining industrial growth.

Knowledge on the nature and level of sustainable farm management (SFM) practiced provides opportunities for supporting the competitive advantages of paddy farmers to sustainably break away from the poverty cycle. Little attention has been given to measuring the performance and impact of SFM on the improvement of paddy farmers livelihoods in Malaysia. Without understanding SFM, it is difficult to make policies and provide targeted, impactful support to paddy farmers. This study aims to evaluate the level of Sustainable Farming Management (SFM) among paddy farmers by applying the Sustainable Farm Management Index (SFMI), in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the Rice Check (RC) by the Department of Agriculture. Additionally, it seeks to analyze the key factors and their impact on enhancing paddy yield in Malaysia’s main granary areas. A set of structured questionnaire was designed to capture the eleven elements of farming practices based on the RC and was then distributed to 500 paddy farmers in Malaysia’s main granary areas, namely Muda Agriculture Development Authority (MADA), Kemubu Agriculture Development Authority (KADA), and Integrated Agriculture Development Authority Barat Laut Selangor (IAD-BLS). Each practice was given a score to determine whether the guidelines were followed. The index ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 being unsustainable and 100 being highly sustainable. A multiple regression analysis was employed as well to estimate the effects of SFM adoption on farmer livelihoods. The findings show that adopting SFM has a positive and significant effect on farmers’ livelihoods. The paper therefore recommends that farmers should be educated on the importance of sustainable farming practices, as this is essential for the sustainable livelihood development of the poor farmers who rely on government subsidies.","Food Science, Ecology, Agronomy and Crop Science","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

This research extends the traditional UTAUT framework by integrating trust and religiosity as additional determinants of technology adoption intention, alongside the model's core constructs of performance expectancy and social influence. Primary data for this study was gathered through a digital survey disseminated to 110 micro-entrepreneurs in the state of Kedah, all of whom are actively registered with the Malaysian Company Commission (SSM), under the auspices of the Ministry of Domestic Trade, Cooperatives, and Consumerism (KPDNKK). The methodological approach is rooted in structural equation modelling, which facilitates a rigorous empirical analysis of the relationships between technological constructs and user intention. The results reveal that trust and performance expectancy, along with social influence, significantly impact micro-entrepreneurs’ intentions to engage with online zakat payment systems. Interestingly, despite the religious nature of zakat, religiosity did not emerge as a significant predictor in the context of this digital payment adoption. This insight suggests that while religious obligation drives the act of zakat itself, it is the technological aspects of trust and anticipated performance that influence the preference for digital payment methods over traditional ones. This research provides valuable implications for zakat institutions and policymakers aiming to foster the digitalization of religious financial transactions. By highlighting key factors that influence digital adoption, the study underscores the potential for zakat management bodies to innovate and promote digital solutions that align with micro-entrepreneurs' expectations and trust requirements. Ultimately, this study charts a path forward for enhancing digital inclusivity in religious financial practices, marking a transition from conventional to modern, technology-enabled means of fulfilling zakat obligations.","Multidisciplinary","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

However, the premium pricing of this variety influenced by supply and demand limits access for many segments of local consumers. The question arises as to whether the local community can afford it by examining the factors driving consumers’ willingness to purchase Musang King durian. A descriptive study was conducted with 110 respondents from Raub, Pahang, which is well known as the largest Musang King production area in Malaysia. The study revealed that the main factors driving consumers’ willingness to purchase Musang King durian are its unique taste, consumers’ income and consumer purchases. Although the income range of the local population is low to moderate, the distinctive taste and purchasing power of consumers are key drivers for purchasing this premium variety. Moreover, other factors, such as the market price of Musang King, the seasonality of its production, and the influence of promotions through acquaintances and social media, also play a role in influencing consumers’ decisions to purchase Musang King durian. The aforementioned factors have increased the demand for Musang King durian both locally and internationally, although its supply is contingent upon production seasons and weather conditions. Therefore, durian growers and the government should collaborate to ensure that supply meets the required levels of production and quality. This is essential to meet the growing demand from both local consumers and international markets. Additionally, attention should be given to expanding the potential market for downstream products derived from Musang King durian so that the market is not focused solely on upstream production.","Multidisciplinary","Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia","Bangi","Malaysia"

This paper introduces three categories of Type II multivariate Laplace region image descriptors based on Lie group theory. Through Lie group theory, we have demonstrated that the Laplace distribution function space is a unique type of Riemannian manifold, specifically a Lie group. Subsequently, we have proven the equivalence between two categories of partitions obtained through isomorphic mapping, leading to the left (or right) coset. Following this, the left (or right) polar decomposition leads to the symmetric positive definite matrix Lie group. Finally, based on the homeomorphic mapping, we obtain the feature descriptor on the Lie algebra at the mean μ of the embedded matrix. The Laplace descriptors are constructed by selecting d low-level or mid-level original features on each pixel. This method is able to handle low-dimensional or high-dimensional features based on actual requirements more effectively. We have conducted image classification experiments on two benchmark datasets and carried out ship target detection tasks on a public naval image set to validate the effectiveness of the Laplace region image descriptors. The results have demonstrated a certain degree of expressiveness and universality, offering a novel method for image information extraction.","Software, Signal Processing, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Artificial Intelligence","Shanghai Maritime University","Shanghai","China"

In Malaysia, forecasts indicate that it will soon reach 24.5 million units of e-waste by the year 2025. Today, higher learning institutions also contribute to the rapidly growing threat of e-waste. Besides mobile phones, the usage of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) equipment at universities keeps increasing and contributes to the increased quantity of e-waste, while the handling and disposal methods of e-waste still need to be improved. The purpose of this paper is to examine the current e-waste management system as well as to investigate the critical challenges constraining e-waste management at public universities in Malaysia. By using a qualitative approach, a number of interview sessions have been conducted with the responsible departments at six established public universities in Malaysia. It has been found that currently only e-waste generated from used electric and electronic equipment (EEE) which have been declared as university assets are being managed by the responsible departments at the six universities. All six universities are using the standard process of handling their e-waste since every single process needs to comply with the requirements of the Ministry of Finance (MOF). This remains the main constraint to flexibility or improvement of the current system. The universities are also facing some challenges, among others, lack of awareness and knowledge on how to properly handle e-waste among university citizens, no clear sustainable policy at the university, lack of facilities within the university compound to support the proper practice of e-waste disposal as well as lack of education and related training provided to the campus citizens. This paper also provides some recommendations for the improvement of e-waste management towards sustainability and offers an agenda for future research.","Multidisciplinary","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The primary aims of this research endeavour encompass the identification of pivotal variables for the evaluation of higher learning institution’s performance, the creation of an alumni rating index, and the establishment of a performance monitoring tool utilizing dashboard technology. The goals are to enhance performance and service quality of institutions of higher education. The present study utilizes a quantitative research approach and centres its investigation on many cohorts of graduates originating from a prominent Malaysian university. A rigorous cluster sampling procedure was implemented. The assessment of alumni rating is conducted across twelve dimensions, with each component being evaluated using appropriate variables that enable the calculation of the desired index and facilitate the execution of intricate studies. The analytics that were performed and the alumni rating index that was calculated were subsequently shared with stakeholders through the use of an analytical dashboard. The dashboard was developed on user experience (UX) design principles. The evaluation of the produced dashboard is thereafter conducted by a group of stakeholders who have direct involvement in enhancing alumni engagement. The findings suggest that the university attained elevated ratings in the domains of social involvement, educational resources, and financial value. However, the scores for financial aid, student development, and student well-being were significantly lower. Despite the provision of various financial support, the respondents hold the belief that these forms of assistance are inadequate.

However, this increased connectivity also makes IoT networks vulnerable to various types of attacks, one of which is the wormhole attack. A wormhole attack is a type of security threat in which an attacker creates a tunnel between two or more nodes in an IoT network, allowing the attacker to intercept, modify or inject malicious packets into the network. This can lead to serious security issues such as unauthorized access, data leakage and network disruption. The problem of wormhole attack detection in IoT networks is a crucial issue that must be addressed. Traditional security methods, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, may not be effective in detecting and preventing wormhole attacks, as these attacks are difficult to detect due to the stealthy nature of the attacker. Therefore, there is a need for new and more advanced methods for wormhole attack detection in IoT networks, such as deep learning approaches. The goal of this paper is to use a deep learning approach to detect wormhole attacks in IoT networks and to compare the performance of this approach with traditional machine learning methods. This research paper presents a deep learning approach for wormhole attack detection in Internet of Things (IoT) networks using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The proposed method is compared with traditional machine learning techniques which are Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using a malware dataset for predicting the type of wormhole attack (WHR).

For English as a foreign language (EFL) students, writing is a communicative, goal-oriented, laborious process with emotive, behavioral, metacognitive, and cognitive components. Previous studies have provided insight into specific aspects of metacognition in writing, but there is a lack of synthesized research integrating these components to understand how they collectively influence the academic writing performance of EFL student writers. To fill this gap, this study investigated how metacognition theory contributes to the academic writing performance of EFL students from the perspectives of metacognitive knowledge, experience, and strategies. A total of 370 Chinese EFL student writers were invited to complete one academic writing test and three questionnaires in a classroom setting. The resulting data were analyzed using PLS-SEM. Metacognitive knowledge, experiences, and strategies were found to be positively related to academic writing performance. The results also revealed that, among 10 parameters of metacognition, academic writing performance was more strongly correlated with procedural knowledge, metacognitive feeling, metacognitive estimate, online metacognitive strategies, monitoring, and evaluating parameters. These findings underscore the importance of developing students’ conditional knowledge and promoting effective metacognitive strategies, particularly in evaluating and monitoring, to improve academic writing skills among EFL students.","Language and Linguistics, Education, Linguistics and Language, Literature and Literary Theory","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The study examined the existing literature on the legal governance of fintech risks, as published in various journals between 2017 and 2022. Due to strict access control, fintech businesses face challenges implementing their solutions within the financial sector. They are required to obtain the necessary financial business authorisation to proceed. Nevertheless, the present status of fintech businesses within the financial legal system is unclear, resulting in uncertainty regarding their corporate standing, rights, and obligations. As a result, their participation in financial operations may face difficulties regarding legal scrutiny. If a fintech company experiences a technical malfunction during the application process could negatively affect consumers' financial interests. Defining the legal responsibilities between the technical body and the commercial entity can sometimes be challenging. Thus, it is possible to easily incite disruptions in assuming legal responsibilities.

Defects in building can be multi-faceted and multi-systemic. Considerable focus has been placed on the possibility of mitigating the effect of climate change by decreasing human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases. Nevertheless, it is also acknowledged that built environments will be vulnerable to some effects of environmental degradation. The durability of buildings worldwide differs significantly, although it is generally expected that buildings ought to possess a lifespan of several decades. The process of weathering causes the deterioration of building materials, which, if not addressed, can result in an accelerated rate and potentially more severe deterioration. Modifications to maintenance schedules could accommodate slight alterations to the rate of degradation. Nevertheless, in order to achieve substantial enhancements in the pace of degradation, it may be necessary to make changes. On a global scale, the occurrence of any novel degradation mechanisms seems improbable. Yet, sometime in the future, earlier inconsequential issues may begin to assume importance at the local scale, due to a dearth in regional expertise or awareness. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the influence of climatological factors on defects in buildings. The findings revealed that the primary causes of damage resulting from climate were moisture, fungal growth, mold, blistering, and corrosion. The problems originated from several factors like rain, condensation, atmospheric moisture, water leakage, humidity, high temperatures, UV radiation, dampness, oxygen, salt, and acids.","Multidisciplinary","Universiti Sains Malaysia","Minden","Malaysia"

These defects have the potential to reduce the lifespan of the building by compromising its structural integrity. The occurrence can be attributed to inadequate design, substandard workmanship, or non-compliance with the specified design standards. Deficiencies adversely affect the tenants' satisfaction and diminish the intrinsic worth and functionality of the structure. The deterioration of each component exacerbates when there are chemicals present in the environment that induce deterioration to the structure. Agents such as mechanical forces, electromagnetic radiation, thermal fluctuations, chemical reactions, biological processes, and natural catastrophes can induce alterations in building materials and components, ultimately impacting the structural integrity of the building. The aims of this study were to identify aetiology and pathology of soil settlement, analyze the elements that contribute to it, and examine the indicators of soil subsidence. The findings revealed that common types of soil settlements were immediate settlement, consolidation settlement, creep settlement, uniform settlement, differential settlement and curve settlement. The factors that led to such deficiencies were roots of trees, soil compositions and types, collapsing cavities, unstable foundations, drainage problems, insufficiently consolidated soil, effect of vibration and sinkholes.

The manufacturing industry's product life cycle and technology are becoming outdated faster; therefore, businesses must improve their resources, skills, and innovation processes to not only provide goods that meet requirements but also do so quickly to sustain them. This study conceptualizes while following the RBV theory, which posits that unique organizational resources can facilitate the achievement of competitive advantage. Considering the dynamic situation of business markets, unique organizational capabilities can create differentiation and ensure survival in the longer run. These unique capabilities include several factors, i.e., innovative skills, networking, new technology utilization and strategic processes. Thus, this study considers three key organizational capabilities, i.e., organizational collaboration (with partners and suppliers), the capacity for product innovation, and the adoption of advanced technology to achieve sustainable performance among large-scale textile manufacturing firms. Furthermore, this study also shows that the establishment of a green organizational culture differentiates the firm, as it can align the individual’s mindset with the firm’s green norms and values and can be helpful for achieving sustainable performance. This study can be helpful for future studies to identify the key factors that can be helpful in achieving sustainable performance in large-scale textile firms. Furthermore, this study provides insights into the textile sector, as business practices and customer requirements are rapidly changing, which poses the challenge of sustaining highly uncertain business markets. Therefore, this study will be helpful for adjusting their unique capabilities to achieve sustainable performance.

This work carries out a synopsis of the investigations that reveal or calculate the energy consumption of buildings. Prisma methodology has been followed for its realization. The investigation reveals that more than half of the publications have focused on residential buildings. The search for manuscripts in a systematic way did not give the expected results, so the identification of studies via other methods was necessary. In fact, more than 90% of the search has been carried out on publications obtained by other means. These have been based on the iterative search for references from those initially obtained by the Prisma methodology. In addition, a classification based on the use of the building and how the studies have been published is presented.

One of the recent studies includes the examination of FLP issues in a large room. Analysing the layout of amenities and temperature controls in spacious areas like libraries is crucial for understanding how they affect people’s thermal comfort and energy consumption. The arrangement of facilities typically impacts the air distribution within a large room. Improper facility layout design might create indoor temperature disparities, with specific zones feeling excessively warm or chilly. Consequently, users are unevenly distributed due to each individual’s differing thermal comfort needs. Previous researchers have discussed this issue. However, after a detailed examination of previous studies, a few drawbacks have been identified in building mathematical models. These drawbacks include poorly organised mathematical modelling, ambiguous or disorganised data collection and analysis techniques, and the absence or ambiguity of variables and constraints. Therefore, this study proposed a structured mathematical approach to build a more efficient, inclusive, and reliable model. This study used a university library in Malaysia as a case study. A well-established and widely practised method for assessing mathematical modelling competency based on previous research has been adopted. Subsequently, the list of sub-competencies associated with the modelling process is utilised as a reference point for constructing a mathematical model in this research endeavour. As a result, the entire process of constructing a mathematical model is detailed, and recommendations for future enhancements are provided. This project is considered a significant advancement in the pursuit of conducting further FLP investigations in large rooms for the greater good in the future, which is part of the PhD research carried out at UUM.","Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

While spectral imaging offers a promising solution, it has several drawbacks, such as complexity, high cost, and limited spatial resolution. Machine learning has emerged as a potential solution for plastic waste due to its ability to analyse and interpret large volumes of data using algorithms. However, developing an efficient machine learning model requires a comprehensive dataset with information on the size, shape, colour, texture, and other features of plastic waste. Moreover, incorporating near-infrared (NIR) spectral data into machine learning models can reveal crucial information about plastic waste composition and structure that remains invisible in standard RGB images. Despite this potential, no publicly available dataset currently combines RGB with NIR spectral information for plastic waste detection. To address this research gap, we introduce a comprehensive dataset of plastic waste images captured onshore using both standard RGB and RGNIR (red, green, near-infrared) channels. Each of the two-colour space datasets include 405 images that were taken along riverbanks and beaches. Both datasets underwent further pre-processing to ensure proper labelling and annotations to prepare them for training machine learning models. In total, there are 1,344 plastic waste objects that have been annotated. The proposed dataset offers a unique resource for researchers to train machine learning models for plastic waste detection. While there are existing datasets on plastic waste, the proposed dataset aims to set itself apart by offering a more comprehensive dataset with unique spectral information in the near-infrared region. It is hopeful that these datasets will contribute to the advancement of the field of plastic waste detection and encourage further research in this area.","Multidisciplinary","Universiti Malaysia Sabah","Kota Kinabalu","Malaysia"

The study examines six safety measures elements: safety and rescue equipment, ship structure, shipping documentation, navigation and communication equipment, safety instruction for passenger, and ability of ferry employees to respond to emergencies. Data collection was conducted using simple random sampling techniques, with responses from 130 MMEA personnel. Descriptive analysis was then performed to determine the perceived importance of 25 safety measure items. The findings indicate that firefighting facilities, with a mean score of 4.91, were considered the most important safety item, while medical equipment, with a mean score of 4.16, was ranked the least important. These results provide ferry operators with a deeper understanding of critical safety features, enabling them to prioritize safety, reduce incidents, and protect the marine environment. This study contributes to underrepresented research on passenger ferry safety and has the potential to improve safety management in other modes of transportation. The safety evaluation criteria and dimensions can serve as safety performance indicators, improving both safety assessment and safety management practices.","Geography, Planning and Development, Transportation, Urban Studies","Universiti Malaysia Terengganu","Kuala Terengganu","Malaysia"

Nanofluids are composed of three distinct kinds of nanoparticles that are spread throughout a base fluid. These nanoparticles display a variety of sophisticated thermophysical properties. Ternary hybrid nanofluids are advantageous for usage in the cooling of electronic devices, microchips, and nuclear reactors due to their increased thermal conductivity. The stretching/shrinking sheet models the behavior of cooling surfaces in high-performance heat exchangers. When applied to a stretching sheet, the Hiemenz flow model replicates the process of cooling thin, flexible surfaces that are contained inside microchannels. As a result of the radiative heat effect, these fluids are able to absorb more heat, which results in an improvement in the cooling performance of electronic devices that create large thermal loads. The equations of Navier–Stokes have been transformed into equations of self-similarity by applying appropriate transformations of similarity variables. These equations have been numerically resolved by using the three-stage Labatto-three-A method. Dual solutions are achieved in specific ranges of parameter. There is no discernible increase or reduction in the values of skin coefficients, friction, and heat transfer rate in the dual solutions domain when the solid volume percent of titanium dioxide is increased. In the presence of an increase in the value of the solid volume fraction of titanium dioxide, the rate of heat transfer improved. The thickness of the thermal boundary layer (BL) increased with thermal radiation but decreased with the Prandtl number. Furthermore, temporal stability analysis reveals that the first solution exhibits superior long-term stability.","Analysis, Applied Mathematics","Arab Open University","Riyadh","Saudi Arabia"

Due to the ongoing anti-immigrant sentiments, we argue that the refugee crisis and the build-up to it affect how resident immigrants are looked upon in a negative light; this in turn could consequently be reflected in their life satisfaction. We anchor the natives’ hostility toward the refugees and immigrants on the group-threat theory. Design/methodology/approach: Using two waves of the European Values Study, we exploit the exogenous source of variations generated by the crisis and employ a difference-in-differences estimation framework to identify the causal impact. Findings: Our findings indicate negative impact of the refugee crisis on resident immigrants’ life satisfaction. We find negative impact of the refugee crisis on the life satisfactions of resident immigrants with low education levels. Our results also suggest that resident immigrants in Western European countries experience lower life satisfaction after the crisis. Originality/value: The literature so far mostly revolves around the impact of the crisis on natives’ objective well-being.

The principal goal of this study is to explore the behavior of coefficient skin friction and heat transfer with the permeability parameter for the suction aspect, as well as the behavior of solid volume fraction against the stretching/shrinking effect. The impact of the permeability parameter, magnetic, shrinkage parameter, and viscous dissipation on the temperature profile and velocity of sodium alginate-hybrid nanofluid flow are also incorporated in the present investigation. The governing equations in the form of partial differential equations (PDEs) are transformed into the form of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), implementing a similarity variable having exponential similarity. The ODE system is numerically solved using the Three-stage Labatto III-A technique included in the bvp4c solver with the MATLAB program. Two branches’ solutions are obtained when the pertinent parameters are varied over defined ranges. Non unique solutions are obtained when the critical point reaches suction greater or equal to suction critical points and shrinking paramter greater or equal to shrinking paramter critical points for suction and shrinkage effects respectively. In addition, the upper branch has a significant increase in reduced skin friction and heat transfer when the permeability parameter is raised, whereas the lower branch experiences a decrease. The heat transfer rate diminutions in the upper branch solution and increases in the lower branch solution as the solid volume percentage of copper increases. Temperature profiles decrease as permeability parameter values improve. As Eckert's value increases, the temperature profile also improves.","Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics, Materials Science (all), Condensed Matter Physics, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

It implies that there is an excess of labour supply in the market at the current wage rate. As a result, the rate set is higher than equilibrium, signifying firm disadvantages. The negative effect is more prevalent if the single national minimum wage rate policy is applied to all states. Therefore, the national wage policy should be thoroughly examined.

Moreover, the impact of Forchheimer, suction, and MHD parameters on magnitudes of reduced skin friction and heat transfer were examined using the Tiwari-Das model. The governing equations of the considered problem are transmuted into the appropriate structure of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by employing the linear similarity variables. The resulting model of ODEs is numerically solved utilizing the “three-stage Labatto III-A technique” provided in the “MATLAB software's” bvp4c solver. In addition, to make evaluations, the current numerical results are compared with those from previous studies. Dual branches are created by the ODE governance system. With the aid of stability analysis, a single stable branch is identified. Reduced (Formula presented.) in both branches has been shown to increase the reduced heat transfer rate. In addition, the outcomes demonstrated that the number of branches is dependent on the parameter ranges for suction, porosity, and magnetic for a given value of the parameter for rotation. Moreover, temperature profile enhanced as increased the amount of heat source strength. Dual branches are obtained for specified assortments of the related parameters. Moreover, when the solid volume of copper was improved, the strength of reduced heat transfer intensified toward the Forchheimer parameter and declined in MHD and suction effects for both branches.

Although AI chatbots have brought many opportunities to education and teacher trainees, they have also caused many problems and resistance among some teacher trainees. However, previous studies have focused more on the influence of positive acceptance factors induced by AI chatbots and less on the negative barrier model induced by AI chatbots. Therefore, this study starts from the negative barrier factors induced by AI chatbots and builds an influencing barrier model of AI chatbot resistance guided by Innovation Resistance Theory (IRT) and appropriately draws on Cultural Dimension Theory (CDT), Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), and practical characteristics. The questionnaires mainly adopt convenience sampling and snowball sampling methods, and the data are empirically analyzed. The results show that Uncertainty Avoidance, the Social Influence Barrier, and Technology Anxiety have a significant and direct influence on teacher trainees’ resistance to AI chatbots. Meanwhile, Uncertainty Avoidance, the Social Influence Barrier, and Technology Anxiety play significant mediating roles in the impact of the Usage Barrier (UB), Image Barrier (IB), Value Barrier (VB), Risk Barrier (RB), and Tradition Barrier (TB) on resistance behaviors, revealing the complex path through which cognition-emotion-society factors jointly shape technology resistance behaviors. Therefore, this study not only contributes to enriching the theoretical results of combining Innovation Resistance Theory with AI chatbots and adding new research paths (e.g., the mediating role of Uncertainty Avoidance) but also provides a practical guide for the dissemination of AI chatbots among teacher trainees and future technological talents in a sustainable future.","Computer Science (miscellaneous), Geography, Planning and Development, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment, Environmental Science (miscellaneous), Energy Engineering and Power Technology, Hardware and Architecture, Computer Networks and Communications, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The progress of virtual reality technology makes it possible for VR to enter the traditional classroom. This paper is an empirical study of the advantages of VR technology in environmental art and design education to verify whether the application of VR technology in classroom education can help to improve the spatial ability of college students to hopefully give some suggestions to peer educators. Therefore, in this study, we chose the traditional course of Decorative Arts and Construction Crafts and added the VR teaching model, and we used the pre-test and post-test quasi-experimental design of experimental and comparison group classes (N=68), and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVAS) using IBMSPSS software. The results showed that the VR technology-based course had a positive effect on improving the spatial ability of college students compared to the traditional classroom, in which the effect on mental rotation and spatial visualization ability was significant, in addition, this VR teaching model had a positive but insignificant effect on the improvement of spatial orientation ability.","Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks and Communications, Computer Science Applications, Media Technology, Modeling and Simulation, Education","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The focus is on enhancing returns and reducing risk, providing a Shariah-compliant framework for Islamic investors. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses quantile regression and Monte Carlo simulation to analyse the diversification benefits of stablecoins (Tether [USDT] and Tether Gold [XAUT]) and traditional cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin [BTC]) across different Islamic indices by market capitalisation size from 31 December 2020 to 1 July 2024. Findings: BTC increases returns but with higher volatility, which may conflict with the principles of Islamic finance. However, when viewed from a portfolio perspective, pairing BTC with stablecoins like USDT and XAUT can provide stability and risk mitigation. This strategy aligns better with Maqasid Shariah by minimising excessive uncertainty (Gharar) and offering tangible asset backing. These strategies are particularly relevant to large-cap indices. However, the increased risk in Islamic Mid and Islamic Small portfolios suggests that the diversification benefits are less pronounced for these indices. Practical implications: The results offer practical insights for investors, portfolio managers, Shariah advisors and policymakers in asset allocation and risk management. Incorporating stablecoins and cryptocurrencies can optimise risk-adjusted returns in Islamic portfolios. Originality/value: To the best of the authors knowledge, this study is the first to integrate Maqasid Shariah principles in the evaluation of stablecoins and traditional cryptocurrencies, extending the literature on Islamic finance and digital assets. This research offers empirical evidence on the performance and compliance of these assets within Islamic portfolios, providing a comprehensive framework for Shariah-compliant investment strategies.","Business and International Management, Finance, Strategy and Management","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

This study uses all Indonesian Islamic banks (IB) from 2015–2020 using quarterly data. Findings: The competition positively affects the Z-score and negatively influences the FLP. Furthermore, higher concentration is positively linked to the Z-score but is negatively related to the FLP. This study also incorporates a quadratic term of the competition to examine the competition-stability nexus. The findings indicate that the squared competition is negative for the Z-score and positive for the FLP. In general, this study confirms the competition-stability view.

Despite the ratification of international agreement and the enactment of domestic laws, such as Law No. 35 of 2014, the enforcement of these laws is inconsistent. This inconsistency is attributed to legal ambiguities, limited institutional capacities, and cultural attitudes that normalize exploitation. Employing a socio-legal approach, this research integrates legal analyses with field interviews to investigate the causes, manifestations, and legal management of CSEC. The findings reveal systemic shortcomings, such as the absence of specific criminalization for child prostitution and trafficking in the Criminal Code, ineffective implementation of regional regulations, and poor collaboration among law enforcement agencies, NGOs, and government entities. CSEC continues to be a pervasive issue, with victims often misidentified as offenders. The study advocates for legal harmonization with international standards, enhanced institutional collaboration, heightened public awareness, and community-based monitoring initiatives. It stresses the urgent need for child-rights-centric legal reforms to tackle the socio-cultural factors driving exploitation and to strengthen the protective role of both the state and society.","Social Sciences (miscellaneous), Law, Sociology and Political Science, Political Science and International Relations","Sekolah Tinggi Agama Islam Negeri Majene","Majene","Indonesia"

A total of 417 responses were collected and analyzed to test the proposed hypotheses. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to evaluate variable factorability, followed by confirmatory factor analysis to validate the measurement model’s reliability and fit. Structural equation modeling was employed to assess the relationships between corporate sustainability and CWB. The findings reveal that comprehensive sustainability efforts can significantly reduce CWB by fostering ethical workplace climates and aligning organizational values with employee expectations. However, in high-pressure contexts like construction, sustainability initiatives may paradoxically increase CWB if perceived as burdensome or poorly managed. Employee responses to sustainability practices were found to vary depending on contextual and relational factors, either enhancing positive behaviors or exacerbating negative ones. These results highlight the importance of integrating ethical leadership, corporate values, and supportive work environments to achieve effective sustainability outcomes. Organizations are encouraged to design sustainability practices that balance employee well-being with organizational objectives, fostering a collaborative and ethically grounded workforce capable of driving long-term success.","Artificial Intelligence, Computational Theory and Mathematics, Education, Business, Management and Accounting (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

These institutions are continuously adapting to a rapidly evolving global landscape, where competition for resources, students, and academic prestige is intense. This study delves into the role of organizational culture in shaping the effectiveness of Algerian HEIs, an area that has received limited attention in the literature. Specifically, the research examines how different types of organizational cultures—clan, adhocracy, market, and hierarchy—are linked to institutional effectiveness. The study employs a cross-sectional research design, with data collected through structured questionnaires distributed to college deans and their representatives across multiple HEIs in Algeria. Out of 349 responses, 334 were deemed valid, resulting in a strong response rate of 67.6%. Data analysis was conducted using a combination of descriptive statistics through SPSS and structural equation modeling via Smart PLS 4.0, allowing for a comprehensive examination of the relationships between organizational culture and effectiveness. The findings affirm the study's theoretical framework, demonstrating that organizational culture is a significant determinant of institutional effectiveness in HEIs. Notably, hierarchy and market cultures were identified as having a significant positive impact on effectiveness, suggesting that structured environments with clear goals and a focus on performance contribute to superior outcomes in higher education settings. On the other hand, clan and adhocracy cultures did not show significant associations with institutional effectiveness, highlighting the complexity of cultural influence within educational institutions. This research is among the few, and possibly the first, to examine the relationship between organizational culture and the effectiveness of HEIs in Algeria. The study offers valuable insights for policymakers and educational leaders seeking to enhance HEIs by focusing on cultural dimensions that improve organizational effectiveness.","Multidisciplinary","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze data from 391 valid questionnaires, the study highlights the significant role of perceived advantage, novelty, and risk in shaping consumer attitudes toward smart retailing. The results demonstrate that perceived advantage significantly and positively influences consumers' attitude toward smart retailing (β = 0.453, t = 7.461, p < 0.001). Similarly, perceived novelty strongly influences attitude (β = 0.286, t = 5.193, p < 0.001). In contrast, perceived risk has a negative effect on attitudes toward smart retailing (β =-0.152, t = 3.520, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the study reveals that the attitude toward smart retail significantly influences the acceptance of smart retail technologies (β = 0.780, t = 26.484, p < 0.001). Moreover, the mediating role of attitude is confirmed, mediating the relationship between perceived advantage, novelty, risk, and the acceptance of smart retailing. Specifically, perceived advantage (β = 0.353, t = 6.806, p < 0.001) and perceived novelty (β = 0.223, t = 5.131, p < 0.001) positively influence acceptance through attitude, while perceived risk has a negative indirect effect (β =-0.118, t = 3.456, p < 0.001). These findings underscore the critical importance of consumer attitudes in mediating the impact of perceived advantage, novelty, and risk on the adoption of smart retail technologies.

A numerical study was conducted to investigate the flow characteristics of water-based-alumina copper hybrid nanofluids towards a power-law form stretching/shrinking sheet. This study also considered the influence of magnetic, Joule heating, and thermal slip parameters. This study is significant because it advances our understanding of hybrid nanofluids in the presence of magnetic fields, power-law form stretching/shrinking sheet, and heat transfer mechanisms, providing valuable insights for optimizing and innovating thermal management systems in various industrial applications such as polymers, biological fluids, and manufacturing processes like extrusion, plastic and metal forming, and coating processes. The main objective of this study is to examine the impact of specific attributes, including suction and thermal slip parameters on temperature and velocity profiles. In addition, this exploration examined the reduced skin friction and reduced heat transfer in relation to the solid volume fraction copper and magnetic effects on shrinkage sheet and thermal slip parameter on suction effect. To facilitate the conversion of a nonlinear partial differential equation into a collection of ordinary differential equations, it is necessary to incorporate suitable similarity variables into the transformation procedure. The MATLAB bvp4c solver application is utilized in the conclusion process to solve ordinary differential equations. No solution was found in the sort of when ∊ < ∊ci, and γ < γci. As the intensity of the Eckert number increases, the temperature profile and boundary layer thickness also increase. The reduced heat transfer rate upsurged in both solutions for solid volume fraction copper for shrinking sheet, while the opposite actions can be noticed in both solutions for thermal slip parameter for suction effect. Finally, the study conducted an analysis to identify two distinct solutions for shrinking sheet and suction zone, while considering different parameter values for the copper volume fractions, magnetic and thermal slip condition effect.","Modeling and Simulation, Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes","Universiti Malaysia Perlis | Universiti Utara Malaysia","Arau | Sintok","Malaysia | Malaysia"

These issues include wages, compensation and benefits, working hours, rest days, leave and public holidays. Young workers often face unfair treatment by platform providers while performing their tasks. The research objectives of this study are twofold: firstly, to analyse the labour rights of workers from an Islamic perspective and secondly, to explore how the labour rights of young workers on digital labour platforms can be improved through Islamic principles. A qualitative method is employed to achieve these objectives. The content analysis method is used to analyse secondary sources relevant to this study. The main sources of this research are the Qur’an, hadith and journal articles. Additionally, the Employment Act 1955 (Act 265) and the Children and Young Persons Employment Act 1996 (Act 350) are also analysed to reach the objectives of this study. The findings of this study show that Islam promotes justice in the employment relationship between employer and employee.

To explore this concept within diverse cultural contexts, this study delves into ICC in the Chinese setting using a qualitative approach. Byram’s ICC model served as the theoretical foundation, guiding the investigation into English as a foreign language (EFL) undergraduates’ experiences and perceptions regarding factors that influence intercultural communication, the qualities of effective intercultural communicators, and the challenges encountered in intercultural interactions. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 17 purposively selected undergraduates and analyzed using Nvivo 12. The findings revealed nine crucial factors for ICC: knowledge, attitude, language competence, awareness, skills, empathy, motivation, mindset, and personal traits. These factors align with the scholarly notion that ICC is typically categorized into cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions. The study supports Byram’s model in understanding ICC, and further reinforces the significant role of language competence in developing ICC within the Chinese context. The study provides a nuanced understanding of ICC by emphasizing mindset, influenced by traditional Chinese cultural values, as a distinctive factor in intercultural communication. The research enhances understanding of how these factors impact communication effectiveness and personal growth among Chinese students, offering insights for enhancing ICC education.","Arts and Humanities (all), Social Sciences (all)","Zhejiang Yuexiu University of Foreign Languages","Shaoxing","China"

A two sided group chain sampling plan (TSGChSP) is used in this paper. Based on both risks probability of lot acceptance, L(p) is determined. Four different quality regions are estimated for specified values of producer’s and consumer’s risks. By satisfying the specified design parameters, it is assessed that as the value of design parameters increases, the proportion of defectives decreases such as g,r,i, j, β and α. In comparison TSGChSP is compared with existing Bayesian two sided group chain sampling plan (BTSGChSP). If both plans are applied under similar environments, then the results explain that the TSGChSP produces a lower proportion of defectives than the BTSGChSP. Hence, we suggest that TSGChSP is better substitute for lot inspection in the manufacturing industry, particularly for those working with destructive testing of high-quality products.","Statistics and Probability, Computational Mathematics","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

With the progressive improvement of AI innovation in a few areas, particularly in architectural design, it has risen above the confinements of conventional design strategies and opened up modern measurements for the expression of architectural aesthetics. Midjourney technology not only promotes design innovation but also improves the efficiency and flexibility of the design process. Compared to conventional architectural design software such as AutoCAD, Revit and SketchUp, Midjourney shows significant advantages in innovation and user experience. In addition, the study discusses the potential of AI technology to drive the development of architectural aesthetics, especially in generating architectural renderings through AI, which presents unique visual and sensory experiences. Even though the application of AI innovation in architectural design still faces numerous challenges, such as not only technical adaptability, and cost-effectiveness issues, but also application in several social and natural settings. This study points out the direction for future research.

These challenges include financial constraints from corruption and insecurity and limited IT resources and infrastructure access. Consequently, adopting Cloud Computing Software as a Service (CC-SaaS) presents a potentially advantageous solution. It offers SMEs an avenue to enhance operational efficiency through cost-effective technological integration, facilitating improved e-services for citizens and promoting knowledge sharing for increased benefits. However, the adoption of CC-SaaS remains relatively limited within the Pakistani SME landscape, beset by numerous obstacles, like data privacy, legal compliance and security concerns. Despite the extensive literature on factors influencing cloud computing (CC) adoption, most of these studies emanate from developed nations. More attention has been devoted to examining the adoption of CC-SaaS. Indeed, within countries marred by conflict and instability, the adoption landscape of CC-SaaS remains largely uncharted. This study addresses this knowledge gap by investigating the determinants influencing organizational intentions regarding adopting CC-SaaS among Pakistani SMEs operating in an environment fraught with conflict. It necessitates examining how the prevailing conflict dynamics in Pakistan might impact CC-SaaS adoption within the country. Ultimately, this research aspires to benefit SME organizations in Pakistan and contribute to validating measurement frameworks for future studies. The study's conceptual model draws upon the Technology-Organization-Environment theory and the Organization Support Theory. Expert opinions informed the identification of moderating effects. Data was collected from a sample of 368 SME managers operating in Pakistan. Subsequently, the collected data underwent analysis employing the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) approach. The study findings indicate that the impacts of technology organization, environment and Organization Support Theory on CC-SaaS adoption are statistically significant.","Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The degree of corruption is assessed with the Corruption Perceptions Index by Transparency International and the Control of Corruption provided by the World Bank. Findings: The finding shows that the level of corruption in Somalia is high and complex because of the following reasons: weak governance and poverty, culture and tradition which include favoritism based on clan membership, lack of accountability mechanism and absence political will. Measures undertaken for anti-corruption, for instance, the establishment of the National Anti-Corruption Commission and legislation for its support face barriers and challenges that include political influence, lack of capacities among the undertaking institution and lack of participation by the public. Originality/value: This research adds value to the knowledge of corruption in Somalia by identifying the concrete socio-political antecedents for corruption and the problems of fighting it. This paper further presents the following detailed strategies to address corruption: enhancing the operational and financial integrity of the Independent Anti-Corruption Commission; restructuring the civil service and merging it into a merit-based system; enhancing Public Financial Management (PFM) reforms; independence of the judiciary; and sustaining development in digital technology adoption in governance and procurement.","Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all), Law","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The data was analyzed thematically using NVivo 12 software. The study also extended the resource-based view theory by incorporating sustainable practices as an advantage for SMEs in the competitive business environment. Findings: This study discovers the antecedents of sustainable practices are awareness, pressures, competitiveness and company image. According to the data, all SME owner-managers indicate that awareness is the main reason for implementing sustainable practices. The consequences of implementing sustainable practices in SMEs are financial issues, limited knowledge and skills and a lack of resources when implementing sustainable practices.

Design/methodology/approach: The study used a sample of 365 firm-year observations of Nigerian-listed nonfinancial companies from 2018 to 2022. Driscoll and Kraay’s fixed-effect standard error regression model is used to test the hypotheses. Findings: The study finds that RMC size, expertise, meeting frequency and membership overlapping with the audit committee have a negative effect on both accrual earnings management (AEM) and real earnings management (REM). While RMC independence is found to have a negative effect on REM. Moreover, additional tests reveal that RMC effectiveness is significantly associated with lower EM practices. Further analysis using the industry level finds that RMC attributes mitigate EM practices in some industries. The results remain after rigorous, robust analysis for endogeneity and alternative regressions. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited to a sample of Nigerian-listed nonfinancial service companies for a period of five years, resulting in the non-generalizability of the findings to different contexts as the countries’ internal policies and regulations varied.

Design/methodology/approach: Employing a time-varying parameter vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) model, the research analyzes sectoral interconnectedness and spillover dynamics, capturing the evolving relationships between REIT subsectors and EPU over time. Findings: The analysis reveals that US REIT subsectors are highly interconnected, indicating substantial internal spillovers. Retail, regional malls and shopping centres are primary shock transmitters, while self-storage, manufactured homes and industrial REITs act as net receivers, demonstrating resilience. Over the study period, Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) generally functions as a net receiver of spillovers from REITs. However, pairwise time-varying analysis shows that EPU transmitted shocks during the economic uncertainties of the 1990s but became a net receiver during the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that disruptions in REIT markets contributed to policy uncertainties during crises. Additionally, the sectors driving volatility shifted over time: residential and apartment REITs were predominant during the 2008 crisis, while disruptions in the office sector were significant during the pandemic.

Using a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected from 402 academic staff and analyzed through partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The model tested the direct effects of LC and KM on OL and their subsequent impact on OC. The results reveal that LC significantly influences OL (β = 0.615, p < 0.001), while KM also has a positive and significant effect on OL (β = 0.203, p < 0.001). OL, in turn, plays a crucial role in enhancing OC (β = 0.754, p < 0.001). Importantly, OL mediates the relationship between LC and OC (β = 0.464, p < 0.001) and between KM and OC (β = 0.153, p < 0.001). The model demonstrated high explanatory power, with OL accounting for 70.2% of its variance (R² = 0.702) and OC explaining 58.5% (R² = 0.585). This research uniquely integrates OL as a mediator in the triadic relationship between LC, KM, and OC, offering new insights into how organizational learning strengthens organizational commitment. It enriches the underexplored context of Chinese higher education and provides practical recommendations for academic leaders and policymakers.

With market expansion and globalization, one of the most challenging issues in the AFSC to connect these diverse research fields with contemporary supply chain trends. Accordingly, it becomes imperative to understand the emerging research structure within the AFSC. This study aims to conduct a comprehensive review of the literature related to the AFSC and proposes a conceptual framework covering the antecedents and outcomes of structural associations among the AFSC factors. This study employs a bibliometric analysis methodology, encompassing 303 papers retrieved from the Scopus database between 1997 and 2021. A rigorous inclusion and exclusion process was carried out by using articles whose titles contained only 'agri-food' and 'supply chain' terms. This systematic approach ensured a feasible dataset for analysis. Microsoft Excel and VOSviewer were used for an in-depth analysis of prolific authors, article trends, institutions, countries, influential articles, and source titles within the domain of AFSC. Co-occurrence analysis was conducted to identify seven core research themes, namely: agri-food supply chain system; agri-food supply chain management; agri-food supply chain industry; agri-food supply chain risk factors; agri-food supply chain information; agri-food supply chain advancement; agri-food supply chain risk management; This study makes a significant contribution by constructing a comprehensive conceptual framework that logically organizes these thematic factors, aligning future research with emerging trends. Additionally, this research highlights the imperative of global collaboration across diverse regions and fields within AFSC to build more resilient supply chains capable of adapting to evolving conditions.","Food Science, Agronomy and Crop Science, Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

It seeks to understand how various values, such as functional, social, emotional, conditional, and epistemic, influence passenger perceptions and experiences providing insights for enhancing rail transit services. This study employs a self-administered questionnaire distributed to 418 passenger rail transit users in Kuala Lumpur city centre over a three-month period. Smart-PLS software was utilized to examine relationships between consumption values and passenger satisfaction. The study findings reveal strong support for functional and social values in influencing passenger satisfaction within rail transit systems of emerging economies. Similarly, emotional and conditional values also play a significant role. Surprisingly, epistemic value does not exhibit substantial influence, highlighting potential disparities in passenger perceptions and priorities. Rail transit operators and regulators should focus on these facets of consumption values in order to maximize passenger satisfaction in rail transit. Conditional aspects such as safety, punctuality, frequency, and accessibility should also be given priority. What is new to the existing literature is that epistemic value was confirmed as the trivial predictor of passengers' satisfaction in rail transit. Hence, clear signage, informative announcements, or accessible digital resources provided by the transit authority will enhance passengers' knowledge and overall experience. Being among a few studies in measuring rail transit satisfaction using the consumption values approach, particularly in the context of Asia-Pacific emerging economies, the empirical results attained broadened the growing literature pertinent to consumer behaviour, consumption values, and sustainable transportation. The findings offer new insights into enhancing rail transit services, emphasizing the need for clear communication and informative resources to boost passenger satisfaction.","Geography, Planning and Development, Transportation","Universiti Teknologi MARA","Shah Alam","Malaysia"

The application of daily soil cover at these landfills is vital for mitigating leachate generation and protecting groundwater from contamination. This study aims to investigate whether a mixture of laterite soil (LS), peat soil (PS), and rice husk (RH) can reduce the migration of heavy metals within a landfill setting. Heavy metal pollution poses a significant environmental challenge in Malaysia, specifically the five metals focused on in this research: Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn. The study evaluates the adsorption capacity of the soil mixture for these metal ions by utilizing laboratory analyses of key parameters such as pH and cation exchange capacity (CEC). To assess the effectiveness of the soil mixture, various combinations were tested, highlighting a blend of 50% LS, 40% PS, and 10% RH as the most effective. An equilibrium study was conducted, wherein metal ion solutions were prepared, allowing the soil mixtures to interact with these solutions until a state of equilibrium was achieved. Subsequently, batch adsorption experiments were performed to measure the mixtures’ ability to adsorb the metal ions, with ongoing assessment of pH and CEC. The results indicate that the selected mixture can significantly reduce metal ion concentrations, demonstrating its potential as a viable daily cover for landfills. Ultimately, this research provides valuable insights into strategies for minimizing heavy metal migration in landfills and safeguarding groundwater resources.","Waste Management and Disposal, Pollution, Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health, Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

By applying a validated model of TOE-TAM-RDT and analysing using PLS-SEM, we found that AI adoption was shaped by competitive pressure, vendor ecosystem, top management support, relative advantage, AI readiness, and innovation climate. The adoption of AI-driven systems among AAFs exerted a positive impact on financial reporting accuracy, and auditing efficiency, while a negative impact on information asymmetry. Results further reveal a significant moderating effect of big data governance, demonstrating that proper management, quality, and ethical use of data within AAFs can amplify AI adoption benefits, boosting financial reporting accuracy, auditing efficiency, and mitigating information asymmetries between AAFs and stakeholders.

The study aims to investigate into how learning orientation and organisational commitment interact and collectively influence the performance outcomes of cooperatives. By employing a systematic random sampling technique, data was gathered from 236 small and micro cooperatives across Malaysia. The analysis was conducted using partial least squares-based structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), a robust statistical method well-suited for examining complex relationships, particularly in studies with relatively small sample sizes. The findings underscore that organisational commitment plays a significant mediating role, enhancing the impact of learning orientation on cooperative performance. This indicates that while a strong learning orientation is essential for cooperative success, its effectiveness is markedly amplified when it is supported by a high level of organisational commitment among members. This suggests that cooperative leaders should prioritize fostering a culture of commitment within their organizations to fully leverage the benefits of a learning-oriented approach. This study contributes to the broader academic discussion by providing empirical evidence from the cooperative sector in a developing country, an area that has been relatively underexplored in previous research. The practical implications are clear where cooperative management should strategically focus on enhancing both learning orientation and organisational commitment to drive better performance outcomes. Moreover, this study sets the stage for future research to investigate these dynamics in various cultural and organisational contexts, thereby broadening the applicability of the findings beyond the Malaysian cooperative sector.","Multidisciplinary","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Overall findings indicated a U-shaped pattern in the shock-transmission mechanism with the higher TPU shocks transmitted towards Islamic stock market volatility at the extreme quantiles and in the long term. The “Extended Joint” QVAR connectedness approach highlights that, in bearish and moderate-volatility conditions (τ = 0.05, 0.50), diversifying portfolios across less shock-prone equity markets like Qatar and UAE can mitigate risk exposure to TPU shocks. Specific economies receiving higher TPU shocks, like Bahrain, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, should implement strategic frameworks, including trade credit insurance and currency hedging, for risk reduction in trade policy shocks during the bearish and moderate-volatility conditions. Conversely, Qatar and Kuwait show the least transmission of error variance from TPU during higher-volatility conditions (τ = 0.95). Moreover, the application of the Frequency-domain QVAR technique underscores the need for short-term speculators to exercise increased vigilance during bearish and bullish volatile periods, as TPU shocks can exert a more substantial influence on the Islamic equity market volatility of Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia. Long-term investors may need to tailor their asset-allocation strategies by increasing allocations to more stable assets that are less susceptible to TPU shocks, such as Qatar, during bearish (τ = 0.05), moderate (τ = 0.50), and bullish (τ = 0.95) volatility.","Accounting, Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous), Strategy and Management","Al Ain University","Al Ain","United Arab Emirates"

Despite this, the abundance of internet resources available to support reading has made reading a more engaging activity. This research examined L2 learners' usage of digital annotation tools (DAT) in a Learning Management System (LMS) to aid the reading of English for Science and Technology (EST) materials in a blended course. The data was collected from a sample of 55 students who were enrolled in a variety of Science and Technology courses at a public institution in Malaysia. The data was gathered through online annotation and focus group interviews and subsequently subjected to thematic analysis using the NVivo software program. The validation of the thematic analysis was conducted through the utilisation of Cohen's Kappa analysis, resulting in a score that approached near perfection. This outcome serves as evidence for the credibility and accuracy of the collected data. Findings revealed that digital annotation tools improved L2 learners' lexical recognition and comprehension. Highlighting and annotating texts showed learners could summarise, justify, reproduce, and rephrase concepts. These annotation analyses supported interview data, showing that learners developed cognitive skills by paraphrasing and synthesising EST academic texts online. This study suggested facilitating successful best practices in online reading settings, where DAT is important in subject content areas for higher education students. This matters because DAT improves L2 learners' cognitive and social development by improving English reading comprehension.","Language and Linguistics, Linguistics and Language, Literature and Literary Theory","Universiti Malaysia Pahang Al-Sultan Abdullah","Pekan","Malaysia"

The effectiveness of technology integration in language learning depends on learners’ attitudes toward it. Hence, the current research investigated Bangladeshi English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners’ cognitive and affective attitudes and their behavioral intentions to utilize ChatGPT for academic writing. The study was conducted among 159 first-year students in Bangladeshi public and private universities. Data were collected by implementing a Likert scale questionnaire. The study used a quantitative approach to explore individual relationships between cognitive and affective attitudes and behavioral intentions. Also, it probed the mediating role of affective and cognitive attitudes on their relationship with behavioral intention. The Pearson correlation coefficient, multiple regression analysis, and bootstrapping were used for data analysis. Findings reveal that both cognitive and affective attitudes, as independent constructs, significantly influenced the EFL learners’ behavioral intentions to use ChatGPT for academic writing. Cognitive and affective attitudes significantly predicted EFL learners’ intentions to use ChatGPT in academic writing, and the affective attitude was found to be the stronger predictor. Results indicate that affective attitude moderately mediates the relationship between cognitive attitude and behavioral intentions. Likewise, cognitive attitude has a moderate influence on the relationship between affective attitude and behavioral intention to use ChatGPT for EFL academic writing. The study suggests that educators promote the use of ChatGPT in academic writing as a cognitive and emotional support tool. Education policymakers are recommended to create a supportive environment for fostering positive attitudes to ChatGPT as an academic writing tool.","Education","Universiti Teknologi MARA | United International University","Shah Alam | Dhaka","Malaysia | Bangladesh"

Despite substantial advancements, a comprehensive understanding of methodologies, applications, and sustainability challenges across diverse contexts remains limited. This systematic literature review aims to address these gaps by examining advancements, regional practices, and adaptation strategies in land suitability assessments. Using the PRISMA framework, an advanced search of Scopus and Web of Science databases identified 34 eligible studies (n = 34) for analysis. These studies were categorized into three key themes: (1) advancements in methodologies, including GIS-based multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM), machine learning, and hybrid models; (2) applications of land suitability for specific crops and regions, highlighting varying ecological and socio-economic factors influencing implementation; and (3) sustainability and adaptation in land use planning, focusing on the integration of climate resilience and resource conservation. Results indicate that GIS-MCDM approaches dominate, representing 65% of the studies, with machine learning and hybrid methods contributing 20% and 15%, respectively. The review underscores the increasing role of advanced technologies such as remote sensing and IoT in improving precision, yet challenges persist in parameter selection, data quality, and integrating socio-environmental dimensions. This review concludes that while progress in methodologies and applications is evident, future efforts must emphasize sustainability and adaptive strategies to address evolving land use challenges. The findings provide critical insights for researchers and policymakers to enhance land suitability assessments and promote sustainable development practices.","Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous), Animal Science and Zoology, Aquatic Science, Plant Science","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

This study aimed to identify the sources of cigarettes and related variables among adolescent smokers in Malaysian schools using the latest national data from the National Health and Morbidity Survey: Adolescents Health (NHMS: AHS) 2022. METHODS We conducted the NHMS 2022: AHS to obtain a representative sample of school-age teenagers via a cross-sectional study design and a multi-stage sampling approach. We selected 1934 school-going adolescents aged 13–17 years who have smoked at least once in the previous 30 days from a total of 33523 respondents in the study. Data were collected from the participants using a pre-validated self-administered questionnaire. The analysis involved calculating adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Furthermore, we examined potential two-way interactions between the independent variables. RESULTS The study found that 6.2% (95% CI: 5.9–6.6) of teenagers in schools are currently smoking, with a notably higher percentage of male to female current smokers (10.8% vs 1.6%). Approximately 23.1% of current smokers are frequent smokers. Almost three-quarters of current smokers obtained their cigarettes from fixed premises (38.9%), and that friends (34.9%) were the primary sources of cigarettes among adolescents. The data show that more than half (59.7%, 95% CI: 57.0–62.4) of current smokers obtained cigarettes from commercial sources. CONCLUSIONS The study found that a notably more significant proportion of adolescent smokers obtained their cigarettes from commercial vendors compared to their friends. These finding implies that increased law enforcement and health promotion programs are needed to lower the incidence of adolescent smoking in Malaysia.","Health (social science), Medicine (miscellaneous), Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Institute for Medical Research","Shah Alam","Malaysia"

The pandemic is having a more severe impact on small-scale tourism products than on others. Therefore, it is urgent to introduce new elements into business models to assist these operators in maintaining operations and sustaining their products. Given that most revenue in the tourism industry comes from small-scale products that directly benefit local communities, tourism operators need to identify the key elements of their business model. The current nine elements of the small-scale business model are the customer segments, value proposition, revenue streams, channels, customer relationships, key activities, key resources, key partners, and cost structure. However, these small-scale tourism operators must add new components to their business strategies for product sustainability to remain competitive today. Hence, the goals of this study were addressed by using the qualitative technique as the research design. Ten informants, including tourism representatives and operators from Johor, Kedah, and Negeri Sembilan, participated in this semi-structured interview. Using NVivo, data were coded, translated as necessary, and transcribed. The content was analysed according to thematic analysis. The new main components of the business model are professional guidance, facilities, travel experience, information delivery, stakeholder collaboration, product management and risk management to guarantee the viability and resilience of small-scale tourism operators. These new findings can assist tourism operators in sustaining their products.","Business, Management and Accounting (all), Arts and Humanities (all), Social Sciences (all), Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)","Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris","Tanjong Malim","Malaysia"

The Travel Bubble program was introduced in selected destinations in response to this crisis. Langkawi Island in Malaysia was chosen as the pilot location for the Travel Bubble initiative, beginning September 16, 2021. This study aims to investigate the impact of the Travel Bubble on Muslim-friendly budget hotels, both during its implementation and 18 months after its inception. This study employs a qualitative approach that entailed semi-structured interviews with seven managers of Muslim-friendly budget hotels. The findings demonstrate that while the Travel Bubble program initially boosted optimism by rejuvenating the tourism industry, it later became clear that the hotels did not equally reap its benefits. For the initial phase, only one theme emerged: Travel Bubble provides short-term benefits. Eighteen months after its launch, three themes were recognised: Langkawi is expensive, business-minded financial management, strategic location and loyal customers. From the findings, understanding and catering to customer needs and preferences is crucial for sustained success. Besides that, Langkawi must engage in sustainable innovations, which entails recognising and leveraging distinctive features to stand out in the market and sustain its competitiveness. Further, often addressing complex challenges requires collaboration and partnership among stakeholders. This study offers several practical implications for the operators of Muslim-friendly budget hotels, such as the importance of agility (adaptability to changing circumstances), resilience (resilience in the face of challenges) and customer focus (attentive to the needs and preferences of guests).","Business, Management and Accounting (all), Arts and Humanities (all), Social Sciences (all), Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

This paper aims to shed the light on other two different strategic orientations that may help enhance SMEs' financial performance in addition to EO, namely; market orientation (MO) and brand orientation (BO). Design/methodology/approach: The three different important strategic orientations are explored through two different studies. The first study was conducted to determine the different effects of the three orientations on SMEs' financial performance. Data were collected using a questionnaire among a convenient sample (131) of business owners/managers, and next PLS-SEM was used for data analysis. The financial performance of firms in the second study is hypothesized to be an outcome of a combination of different strategic orientations; therefore, the fsQCA method is applied to explore the causal recipes of those orientations. Findings: The paper concluded that the three different strategic orientations are collectively, of paramount importance to strategic managers of SMEs. Originality/value: The brand, market and EOs have been discussed discretely in previous studies and this study attempted to provide managers/owners of SMEs with a holistic view of the three different orientations and the amalgamation among them to be beneficial for better financial performance.","Business and International Management, Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","Othman Yeop Abdullah Graduate School of Business","Kuala Lumpur","Malaysia"

Design/methodology/approach: The SERVQUAL and ECT were considered the underpinning theoretical models but are integrated and extended by including a few additional variables. Data were collected from 458 respondents of travelers and hotel customers in Malaysia and analysed by applying partial least squares structural equation model technique. Findings: The empirical results established that significant positive relationships exist between the three newly emerged independent variables (IVs), namely, hygienic practice, greenness of service and digitalization and hotel customer satisfaction towards hotel revisit intention, and only two variables from SERVQUAL, namely, reliability and assurance, have a significant relationship with hotel customer satisfaction towards hotel revisit intention. The results reveal that customer satisfaction has significant direct effect between above-mentioned IVs and customers revisit intention. Research limitations/implications: The use of purposeful sampling method in only one country might limit the generalizability of the results. Future research should be planned to duplicate the current study using a sizable sample of participants from multiple countries and include other related factors related to the pandemic phenomena such as safety, hotel location and health value offered. Practical implications: Theoretical findings imply that service quality is a dynamic theory that should be examined continuously to achieve sustainable and resilient performance in today’s competitive business environment, as some modifications inevitably occur over time and new factors could be emerged. Regarding practical implications, study findings proved the great significance of assurance, reliability, digitalization, greenness and hygienic practices on customer satisfaction towards intention to revisit to hotel. Therefore, it is critical for hotel management to retain hotel business industry in a way that fits and matches customer’s health protection, meets customer’s newly prompted expectations and needs and ensures resilience during unsettled times.

Also, it seeks to find out how TU as a moderator affects EQ and SS in Pakistani private higher education institutions (HEIs). Design/methodology/approach: A total of 440 postgraduate students at eleven private universities in Lahore, Punjab Province, Pakistan, participated in empirical research and data were obtained through the use of an online questionnaire. Simple random sampling was used to choose participants and partial least square structural equation modeling was employed to analyze the data. Findings: The findings revealed that Pakistani private HEIs have a medium level of EQ, TU and SS. Furthermore, the data reveal the existence of a significant positive relationship between EQ and SS, whereas TU as a moderator was found to negatively affect EQ and SS. Research limitations/implications: Postgraduate students of private HEIs in Pakistan were considered for this investigation and this study was limited to testing only in Punjab province. Another limitation of this study is that it was based on a research framework from previous research and literature. This study employed questionnaire surveys to conduct evaluations of teachers' teaching quality by university students. Furthermore, the questionnaire employed student self-evaluations to assess the quality of teaching. The research data would be more detailed if it were possible to include teachers' self-evaluations of their teaching quality. Practical implications: The current study provides key insights for policymakers, higher education commission and HEIs. The results suggest leveraging the identified medium levels of EQ, TU and student satisfaction in Pakistani private HEIs. In an effort to boost the medium levels, policymakers are encouraged to enhance the teaching and learning experience by robustly integrating Web 4.0 technologies. Institutions can intervene strategically by investing in infrastructure and innovative tools aligned with students' technological needs. Likewise, policymakers and institutions can optimize learning management systems (LMS) by developing and implementing policies that encourage their adoption and optimization across HEIs. This may contribute to the accomplishment of the United Nations' sustainable development goal of providing quality education. Moreover, with the help of this research HEIs can establish minimum quality standards regarding academic teaching and learning materials. Implementing the above-mentioned practical implications might boost student satisfaction in HEIs which would benefit not only students but also the institutions. Originality/value: The novelty of the article lies in the fact that it addresses the gap in the existing literature by exploring the levels of EQ, TU and student satisfaction in the context of private higher education in Pakistan. Furthermore, this study investigated whether TU served as a moderator in the relationship between student satisfaction and UNESCO-recommended EQ. This study elaborates on EQ indicators recommended by UNESCO in Pakistan’s private higher education sector.","Software, Control and Systems Engineering, Theoretical Computer Science, Information Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Universiti Malaya","Kuala Lumpur","Malaysia"

This study attempts to shed more light on this anomaly by investigating the determinants of momentum returns. Design/methodology/approach: The panel data technique is applied to the sample of 40 countries worldwide from 1996 to 2018. The authors use the panel-corrected standard error (PCSE) model to estimate the coefficient of World Governance Indicators (WGI), whereas the fixed effect model is used to determine the coefficient for corporate governance indicators (CGIs). The choice of PCSE estimation methods is guided by the fact that WGI variables are subjected to serial correlation, heteroskedasticity and cross-sectional dependence problems while CGI variables are not. Furthermore, a composite WGI index is constructed using principal component analysis (PCA). Findings: Regression analysis shows a negative and significant relationship between WGI index and momentum returns. The negative coefficient value of WGI supports the prediction of the overreaction hypothesis, which postulates a lower behavioral bias in the market with high governance quality. Breaking down of the WGI by their six indicators reveals that four of the indicators (control over corruption, government effectiveness, stability and avoidance of violence) are negative statistically significant with momentum returns while two indicators are not significant. As for CGIs, only one (strength of investor protection) of the four tested indicators is negative and significantly related to momentum returns. Originality/value: The study fills the gap in economic literature by highlighting the association between governance quality at the country (WGI) and firm level (CGI) on stock momentum returns.","Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous), Economics and Econometrics","University of Lahore","Lahore","Pakistan"

These sections are crucial in promoting private hospitals and contributing to the growth of the medical tourism industry. However, limited research has explored the effectiveness of this promotional channel, particularly from a multimodal perspective. Limited prior studies have examined the generic structure of this section by integrating multimodal discourse analysis. This study employs a multimodal move analysis framework to examine the ""About Us"" sections of 41 Malaysian private hospital websites, with ""move"" as distinct strategies or steps that collectively develop rhetorical strategies to fulfill specific communicative purposes. The methodology includes two phases: verbal move analysis, guided by Swales’ genre analysis framework, to identify rhetorical moves expressed through text, and visual move analysis, based on Kress and van Leeuwen’s Visual Grammar Theory, to explore representational, interactive, and compositional meanings of visual elements. The findings reveal how verbal and visual elements interact to achieve cohesive communicative goals. Verbal components emphasize credibility, professionalism, and technological advancements, while visuals such as images, diagrams, and banners evoke trust, engagement, and emotional resonance. Moves like ""Establishing Credentials"" and ""Indicating Value of the Hospital"" are achieved through a combination of text and visuals, creating cohesive representations. This study provides insights into how private hospitals can leverage multimodal strategies to promote their services and attract international medical tourists and collaborators effectively.","Language and Linguistics, Linguistics and Language, Literature and Literary Theory","UNITAR International University","Petaling Jaya","Malaysia"

The angle for both regions is calculated by using the tangent, and the region with a smaller angle resembles the ideal operating characteristics (OC) curve better than the region with a bigger angle. The finding shows that the PQR generates a smaller angle than the LQR, suggesting that the PQR more closely resembles the ideal OC curve compared to the LQR.

Although a vast body of scholarly literature focuses on the well-being of employees, students, and the elderly, the well-being of farmers has not been as extensively studied. Drawing upon Putnam's theory, this study empirically examines how Bonding Social Capital (BOC) and Bridging Social Capital (BRC) influence the well-being of farmers. It specifically explores the role of self-efficacy as a mediator in these relationships to fill the existing research gap. A combination of convenience and random sampling methods was used to collect 443 questionnaires. The primary data analysis was conducted using SPSS and PLS-SEM. The analysis revealed a strong positive relationship between BOC and farmers' well-being. In contrast, BRC did not show a significant correlation. Moreover, self-efficacy significantly mediates the relationship between social capital and the overall well-being of farmers. The findings indicate that while fostering BOC is crucial, farmers should also recognize and utilize the potential benefits of BRC to enhance their well-being. Promoting awareness among farmers and supporting the development and maintenance of BRC are valuable strategies for practitioners working in rural communities.","Multidisciplinary","Guizhou University of Commerce","Guiyang","China"

We review the literature on crypto-asset estate planning and explore lessons from Islamic finance regarding crypto assets. We then use quantitative analysis to compare price-volume relationships in Islamicoin and Bitcoin. To strengthen our analysis, we employ the Kaplan-Meier survival estimate, parametric survival analysis, and the Probit model. Our findings show that Islamicoin's trade volume predicts market price changes more often than Bitcoin's, which seems to be influenced by factors other than trade volume. Further investigation reveals that securities regulators are increasingly enforcing rules against crypto-trading violations. These violations typically occur when trading activity decreases while prices increase. We also find that widespread price changes tend to motivate people to violate the regulations over time. Recently, positive price changes, rather than trade volume, have been the main factor influencing regulatory violations. However, trade effects were observed later in some of our models. Given these findings, we conclude that regulators need to improve digital assets Act to address estate planning issues, in addition to protecting investors.

This study employs a process that consists of three main steps: a thorough review of existing literature, thematic analysis, and the process of gathering and determining readiness factors. Teachers’ perspectives were successfully gathered from 59 pre-university teachers by posting semi-structured questions in a Telegram group of Malaysian pre-university teachers. The study found that most pre-university teachers support the BPPM implementation with the condition that the system can address two primary concerns: server scalability and confidentiality issues. The effectiveness of BPPM implementation depends on its capacity to meet user needs and expectations while delivering clear benefits, along with superiority compared with existing systems.","Education","Universiti Utara Malaysia | MARDI Cameron highlands","Sintok | Pohang","Malaysia | Malaysia"

The automobile industry in Pakistan is one of the most significant industrial sectors, contributing approximately 3% of the country’s GDP and PKR 50 billion. Previously, scholars have discussed the use of TQM practices in different contexts, but this topic has been investigated less in the automobile industry. Furthermore, there are gaps in the literature regarding the relationships among top management commitment, customer focus, supplier quality management, human resource management and supply chain performance (SCP). The current study was designed to measure the impact of total quality management practices (TQMPs) on SCP of the automobile industry in Pakistan. Quantitative research was conducted, and a survey-based questionnaire was administered using a random sampling technique. Data from 155 senior managers representing the outlets of the automobile industry in Pakistan were analyzed using Smart PLS 4. Top management, customer focus, supplier quality, and human resource management are significant antecedents of SCP in Pakistan's automobile industry.

IPO oversubscription is included as a moderating variable. Design/methodology/approach: This research is motivated by the premise that the Pakistani IPO market is characterised by a broad range of institutional and regulatory frameworks. Multiple regression studies, i.e. ordinary least square (OLS) and quantile least square (QLS), were performed on 102 IPOs issued on the Pakistan stock market. Findings: The present study findings suggest that the quality of public service, the independence of civil service from political influences and the legitimacy of government increase investors’ confidence in the prospects of companies, hence increasing the demand for IPO and initial returns. In addition, good regulatory quality enhances market transparency and lowers uncertainty, hence signalling high-quality IPOs and leading in substantial initial returns. The negative effect of the lock-up ratio on the initial return of an IPO is consistent with the risk-return trade-off theory, which asserts that the lock-up ratio indicates the quality of the IPO. Practical implications: The results provide market regulators, policymakers, investors and underwriters with useful data for assuring proper subscriptions of issued shares, as these variables are crucial for company transparency and market efficiency. The findings will also help investors make better IPO subscription decisions.

From this study, it is to provide insights for literature or for practitioners on how FinTech can be used in ISF, such as using blockchain (tools) in waqf (application) that can help to enhance transparency and trust (benefits) with donors. It is important to explore new available tools or applications in ISF markets so that such effort can benefit the industry in promoting its growth. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) was carried out using Reporting Standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses (ROSES) which has been based on quality evaluation criteria, beginning with 41,945 entries in Scopus, 25,386 entries in the Web of Science and 1,590 entries in the Google Scholar databases and ending with 35 articles from data abstraction and analysis, all of which focus on tools, applications and benefits of FinTech in ISF sector. Findings: This review yielded three primary themes and eleven sub-themes addressing FinTech, namely applications (four sub-themes: crowdfunding, blockchain, banking service and peer-to-peer (P2P), tools (three sub-themes: waqf, zakat and sadaqah), as well as benefits (four sub-themes: transparency, innovation, inclusiveness and efficiency). Research limitations/implications: This study emphasises on innovative application of FinTech used in ISF industry which focuses on applications, tools and benefits of FinTech to the industry. However, the findings indicate that there is plenty of room for future investigation. The current work outlines several methodological issues and concerns as well as provides recommendations for future research. Various challenges associated with FinTech applications include inadequate regulations, complex permit application procedures, misuse of FinTech for terrorist financing, the existence of fraudulent FinTech companies and consumer disputes in the FinTech sector concerning ISF. There are few in-depth studies on the possible use of FinTech models in ISF, compared to studies focusing on upcoming challenges. This study also highlights the methodological limitations in previous research efforts, which can be used to improve future studies in this area. To offer a more comprehensive analysis, additional search keywords and engines that have not been included in this study could be used in future investigations with different methodologies. Practical implications: For practitioners, the paper has significant managerial consequences. The analysis provides insights into real-life opportunities, limits and solutions for improving performance management by looking at FinTech applications from a larger and more diverse perspective. The practitioners, especially the State Islamic Religious Council, can recognise the benefits of using FinTech technology in ISF (waqf, zakat and sadaqah), namely under their jurisdiction. Originality/value: This systematic literature assessment identifies critical knowledge gaps that must be addressed such as the applications of FinTech that are still ambiguous, with certain applications not completely embraced in the ISF industry. This study uses SLR technique to categorise literature, identify gaps in current studies and provide recommendations for the research issue (Paul and Criado, 2020), instead of using the other previous methodology such as content analysis or qualitative review. Hence, FinTech is considered an innovative or new approach in ISF industry.","Philosophy, Economics and Econometrics","Universiti Teknologi MARA","Shah Alam","Malaysia"

The extended NAM includes environmental concern (EC), price consciousness (PC) and aesthetic values (AEV). Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative survey design was used to collect 340 valid responses from customers in Pakistan. Partial least square - structural equation modeling was used to assess the hypothesized relationships. Findings: The results show that EC and awareness of consequences have a significant ascription of responsibility (AR) and personal norms (PN) towards INT. The results confirmed the moderating effect of PC on the relationship between PN and INT and the moderating effect of AEV on relationship between PN and INT and AR and INT. The findings indicate that PN does not mediate the relationship between AR and INT. These findings indicate that customers are aware of the consequences of resource depletion and environmental pollution that result from the unsustainable hotel practices. Therefore, customers tend to visit aesthetically green hotels at affordable prices. Practical implications: The study proposes that green hotels should design marketing strategies in a way that increases customers’ awareness and concern towards environmental issues. Marketing campaigns focusing on environmental aspects of green hotels enhance its green reputation and motivate customers to visit green hotels. In addition, managers must consider enhancing the beauty of hotels at a competitive price. Originality/value: This is the first study to use an extended NAM by integrating EC, average variance extracted and PC to predict customers’ INT towards green hotels. The extended NAM framework provides comprehensive understanding of the relationships between EC, AR and PN regarding visiting green hotels.

Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual framework and fractional equity model (FEM) are developed to incorporate big data analytics, artificial intelligence and blockchain technology in an ecosystem for affordability and sustainability of homeownership via the proposed financing model. In addition, the FEM adopts the simulation approach to show its validity in terms of liquidity when compared with traditional home financing. In this regard, this paper is focused on developing and demonstrating the feasibility of a new financing model, rather than testing specific hypotheses or relationships. This is to propose the democratization model for Islamic Home Financing that will not benefit the prospective home buyers without compromising the profitability of the financial institutions. Findings: The findings indicate that the proposed end-to-end solution within the financing ecosystem can lead to more efficient matching market between the buyers and sellers of houses, reduced transaction costs, greater transparency and enhanced efficiency which in the end could lead to lower costs of owning homes and sustained financial resilience among house owners. The findings indicate that the FEM model is able to increase homeownership with more elements of liquidity, marketability and sustainability for homebuyers. Research limitations/implications: This research highlights the potential of big data and blockchain technology in democratizing Islamic home financing and evidence that the transfer of ownership is possible through tokenization. However, this will require a mature financing environment to adapt the technology for practical application. Practical implications: The model proposes a solution to propagate shared prosperity among stakeholders such as the house buyers/owners, sellers, investors as well the government agencies. The proposed FEM model provides alternative home financing that is more marketable, flexible and sustainable for households/buyers and financiers. Social implications: It is hoped that with the proposed financing ecosystem to promote affordability and sustainability of homeownership via big data analytics, artificial intelligence and blockchain technology can lead to greater financial resilience for homeowners which can then be translated to enhanced well-being, increased productivity and can further promote economic growth.

To explore the unexplored, this study aims to examine the efficacy of ICG in preventing bankruptcy and enhancing the ES of Islamic banks operating in Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach: The current study measures ES through Altman's Z-score to analyze the level of the industry's stability and consequently examines the effect of ICG on the ES of Islamic banks in Pakistan for the post-financial-crises period. Using the country-level data, this study utilized a fixed-effect model and two-stage least squares (2SLS) techniques on balanced panel data spanning from 2009 to 2020 to provide empirical evidence. Findings: The empirical results unveiled that board size and meetings have a significant positive influence on the ES while managerial ownership demonstrated an unfavorable effect on ES. Interestingly, the insignificant effect of women directors became significant with the inclusion of controlled variables. Overall, the findings indicate that ICG is an efficient tool for promoting ES in Islamic banks and preventing them from the negative effects of emerging crises. Practical implications: The findings provide concrete insights for policymakers, regulators and other concerned stakeholders to execute a sturdy corporate governance system that not only oversees the economic, social and ethical aspects but also provides measures to alleviate the impacts of potential risks like the COVID-19 pandemic. Social implications: Examining the role of ICG in alleviating bankruptcy risk is an informative and useful endeavor for all social actors. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is one of the first efforts to provide evidence-based insights on the role of ICG in preventing bankruptcy and offers a potential research direction for ES.","Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous), Business and International Management, Management of Technology and Innovation, Strategy and Management","Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS","Seri Iskandar","Malaysia"

This study fills this gap by conducting a comprehensive review of 18 articles out of 81 published between 2019 and 2023, retrieved from the Scopus and Web of Science databases, using the PRISMA framework. Thematic analysis revealed 12 key themes that capture the complex influence of digital platforms on gig workers, suggesting that platforms offer both opportunities and challenges. Digital platforms provide low barriers to entry, facilitate task allocation, and offer flexible work arrangements. However, gig workers face significant challenges, such as a lack of social protections, algorithmic control, intense competition, and downward pressure on wages. The implications are significant for sustainable economic development in the platform economy, underscoring the importance of collective organizing, re-evaluating platform practices, and strengthening labor regulations. As the gig economy expands globally, researchers, platforms, and policymakers must work together to ensure that the benefits of digital platforms are shared more equitably and that gig workers can thrive in this new world of work.

This study aims to investigate the impact of female CEOs on corporate ESG performance and provide a detailed analysis of the underlying mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a sample of listed companies from 2010 to 2021, as reported by Bloomberg. This study uses logit regression models to test hypotheses and conduct robustness tests using the generalized method of moments, propensity score matching and heckman two statge tests. Findings: The research findings indicate that female CEOs can enhance a company’s ESG performance, primarily by elevating the level of green innovation and engaging in more philanthropic activities. When environmental uncertainty is high, the risk-averse attitude of female CEOs may diminish the enhancement of ESG performance. However, granting a higher proportion of equity to female CEOs incentivizes risk-taking, thereby strengthening the improvement of ESG performance. Further analysis reveals that the impact of female CEOs on ESG performance is more significant in non-state-owned enterprises, high-pollution industries, and companies with low financing constraints. Research limitations/implications: The authors have shown that two key ways in which female CEOs enhance a company’s ESG performance are by increasing the level of green innovation and assuming more social responsibility. Nonetheless, this remains a shortcoming of this work, opening a door for future research to examine and enrich. There may be other possible mechanisms explaining the influence of female CEOs on corporate ESG performance. More research is warranted about the CEO’s additional traits, which were not considered in this study but may have an impact on a company’s ESG performance. Finally, while the analysis has delved into the moderating effects of external factors such as environmental uncertainty and CEO ownership on the influence of female CEOs on corporate ESG performance, there is room for exploring whether other factors also play a moderating role in future studies. Practical implications: First, the findings of this study highlight the beneficial societal and economic effects of choosing female CEOs. The inclination to take on social responsibility and care for the environment are both higher among female CEOs. Furthermore, the authors have also discovered that female CEOs possess unique advantages in promoting corporate sustainability and enhancing ESG standards. This can contribute to breaking down stereotypes about gender roles in the workplace. Finally, this research shows that organizational heterogeneity and market risks have an impact on female CEOs’ capacity to improve company ESG performance. Originality/value: A significant innovation of this paper lies in its unique focus on the connection between female CEOs and corporate ESG performance, along with the underlying mechanisms. Against the backdrop of sustainable development, the paper integrates social gender theory, upper echelon theory and agency theory into a comprehensive framework, shedding light on the influence of female CEOs on ESG performance and the associated mechanisms.","Gender Studies, Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The agenda of improving the quality of higher education cannot be separated from improving the quality of lecturers’ career development. Whilst this career development should be similar at all higher education institution, the career development among lecturers at private higher education is somehow behind compared to those at the state higher educat ion institutions. This paper is written based on a study examines the influence of competency factor, organizational culture and achievement motivation on work performance and career development of lecturers at private higher education in Indonesia. The st udy also looks into lecturer work performance as a mediator variable for the relationship between organizational culture and lecturer career development, and l ecturer work performance as a mediator variable for the relationship between achievement motivation and lecturer career development. A total of 210 questionnaires were distributed to research locations and 192 (90%) data is processed using PLS Smart4 Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) statistics. The results of the study show that organizational culture, competency and achievement motivation have direct, positive and significant influence on the work performance of lecturers at private higher education in Indonesia. Furthermore, organizational culture and work performance also have direct and significant influence on lecturer career development. These are similar findings for lecturers at the state higher institution. However, the study findings reveal that neither achievement motivation does not have positive and significant effect on lecturer career development, nor, work performance has full mediation (partial mediation) for the relationship between organizational culture and lecturer career development. Moreover, the relationship between achievement motivation and lecturer career development is not mediated by lecturer work performance. It is concluded that the reasons behind this related to the heavy teaching workload, limited financial resources and unachieved status and reputation as the state higher education insti tutions.","Social Sciences (miscellaneous), Cultural Studies","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

The supply chain (SC) model has been widely used in manufacturing industries and has also been applied in many service industries with the same objectives. However, very few studies for academic libraries, particularly the implementation of the integrated SC model, are being executed, although it has been proven that SC management in practice can enhance stakeholder satisfaction, increase revenues and decrease total costs. The academic library also needs to be successful in providing quality products, services and information to fulfil the library users’ needs within the library budget. This research aims to develop a verified model of the integrated SC for the academic library. Design/methodology/approach: This research used both qualitative and quantitative approaches to achieve its objectives. The proposed conceptual SC model, named as IALSC, for the academic library has been developed using the system thinking method; eventually, it has been validated through the fuzzy Delphi method, an expert judgement technique.

While there are several models of cash waqf operating in different countries, there is increasing demand for innovative cash waqf models, especially within the financial technology context. This paper aims to propose a practical alternative model of funding for waqf institutions using the concepts of crowdfunding and cash waqf. Design/methodology/approach: This study evaluated the literature relevant to cash waqf models that have been implemented in different countries and proposed a new viable alternative model. Findings: Results offer an alternative financing model, named crowdfunding cash waqf model, for waqf institutions to overcome monetary constraints and enable development projects to be completed. Practical implications: The current study has important implications for both officials and relevant stakeholders. It is sought to bring better consistency between cash waqf donors, solving the liquidity problem faced by waqf institutions, enhancing the transparency of waqf institutions and their use of waqf funds, wealth circulation and financing businesses without interest-based loans (riba). By incorporating a crowdfunding and investment mechanism in the model, this method of collecting funds will assist governments in reducing their expenditure on waqf institutions and other social development programmes. Originality/value: The proposed model differs from current methods of generating cash waqf, including those are also internet-based. The proposed model is devised to help waqf institutions achieve financial sustainability by including an investment mechanism in the model to sustain the development of waqf projects.","Business and International Management, Accounting, Strategy and Management","Universiti Malaya","Kuala Lumpur","Malaysia"

Acceptance sampling is one of two key strategies for quality assurance in manufacturing industry, along with statistical process control. After inspection the lot is either accepted or rejected based on the acceptance criteria. If historical information about the product is available, then the most effective approach for making the appropriate judgement is the Bayesian approach. To estimate quality regions, this work presents a Bayesian double group sampling plan (BDGSP). Based on acceptance criteria, the binomial distribution is used to build a likelihood function for defective and non-defective items. The beta distribution is utilized as the prior distribution to determine the average probability of acceptance. For some stated values of producer’s and consumer’s risks, four different quality regions are estimated. The suggested plan estimates variation point values based on various design parameter combinations. Producer’s and consumer’s risks correlate with acceptable quality levels and limiting quality levels of regions, respectively. Operating characteristic curves are used to monitor the effects of change in the values of specified parameters and for comparison with existing sampling plan. Application based on real data set proves that the proposed plan is applicable for existing manufacturing industry policies.","Statistics and Probability, Modeling and Simulation, Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty, Management Science and Operations Research","Jiangsu University","Zhenjiang","China"

Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional survey design was engaged for data collection using structured hand-delivered questionnaires. Partial least square structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized relationships based on a sample response of 170 SMEs from Kano, Nigeria. Findings: GS has no direct impact on both financial performance (FP) and non-financial performance (NFP) of SMEs in Nigeria during the COVID-19 crisis. However, DO demonstrates a constructive direct significant influence on the SMEs’ FP and NFP. Additionally, DO positively moderates the relationship between GS and the FP and NFP. Practical implications: The findings implied that GS could not solitarily make an impact on SMEs’ FP and NFP during crises. Nevertheless, DO is imperative in revitalizing the impact of GS on both performance dimensions of SMEs during disruptions. Consequently, policymakers should consider DO as a precondition for SMEs access to GS, if SMEs performance is the target for improvement. Originality/value: The research model is the first to integrate and empirically validate the moderating effect of DO on the GS and SME performance relationships during crises. The study particularly highlights the role of DO in SMEs during crises and the limited role of GS.

The Internet of Everything (IoE) is a term to describe various interconnectedness that connects people, processes, data, and things through more systematic and practical network connections than ever before. IoE promotes the emergence of new capabilities, enhanced competencies, and exceptional economic prospects for business organizations and communities. In addition, small-sized SMEs use human resource software about 40% and other applications such as inventory management and supply chain management software at a minimal rate. The data indicates that the adoption of IoE establishes an economic barrier for SMEs in Malaysia seeking to reach a high technological readiness level. According to the SME Corp and Huawei survey, the top three impediments to SMEs from adopting digital technologies are a lack of funds, required personnel skills, and technological access. The technological underpinnings of the adoption of IoE include perceived cost, top management support, and market competitive pressure, which leads manufacturing SMEs to apply as a main mechanism. Therefore, this study examines the influence of perceived usefulness, perceived cost, top management support, and market competitive pressure on the adoption of IoE. This study also examines the mediating effects of perceived usefulness on the relationships between perceived cost, top management support, market competitive pressure, and adoption of IoE. The underpinning theories used were the TOE and TAM. Data was collected using the simple random sampling method among manufacturing SMEs who have experienced using the IoE. The questionnaires were distributed online for this purpose. Data gathered from 169 respondents were analyzed using the PLS-SEM approach. The results revealed that perceived cost was significant toward the adoption of IoE, followed by top management support. Perceived usefulness mediates the relationship between perceived cost, top management support, and adoption of IoE. However, market competitive pressures are not significant toward the adoption of IoE. Additionally, governments or policymakers should explore the role of media and communication in highlighting strategies that organizations can adopt to manage and help them in manufacturing. The government should understand these dynamics because it is crucial to develop effective interventions to maintain market stability and ensure equitable access to help SMEs.","Materials Science (all), Media Technology, Marketing","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Such importance applies to not only the large corporations but especially towards Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) including among agropreneurs. However, reports claimed that SMEs particularly agropreneurs are still not effectively practicing entrepreneurial marketing within the business. Therefore, this study aims to observe the relationship between the elements of entrepreneurial marketing namely opportunity focus and value creation on the performance of agropreneur SMEs. Also, this study investigates the moderating role played by the government support programs (GSPs) between the relationship. Using both research advantage (RA) and resource-based view (RBV) theories, a quantitative approach is exploited to meet the study objectives. Over 170 usable questionnaires were gathered and analysed using the latest version of SEM-PLS 4.0 software. The results indicated that opportunity focus has a significant relationship with performance and value creation has an opposite result towards performance. It was also found that GSPs played a significant role in moderating both relationships studied. Practically, this study sheds light on a sturdier role that should be played by SMEs particularly agropreneurs in planning and implementing entrepreneurial marketing. From the policy perspective, it is highlighted that the policymaker needs to revisit its’ training and development program designed for SMEs, especially in encouraging attitude towards both opportunity focus and value creation while continuously supporting the industry players through its’ support programs.","Materials Science (all), Media Technology, Marketing","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

This study aims to examine the factors influencing firms' financial performance both before (2018 and 2019) and during (2020 and 2021) the pandemic, with a focus on financially distressed companies, specifically those listed under Practice Note 17 (PN17) and Guidance Note 3 (GN3) regulations during these periods. In line with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5 on gender equality and women's empowerment, this research also explores the role of gender diversity by analysing the impact of the Bursa Malaysia recommendation, which requires the inclusion of 30% female directors on public-listed companies’ board. Additionally, this study investigates key determinants of financial performance, including liquidity efficiency, financial leverage, operational efficiency, management competency, and board size. The findings indicate that the regression coefficients for all tested variables are not significant across both the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. This suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic did not significantly impact the financial performance of PN17 and GN3 companies. This research extends the application of agency theory to the context of PN17 and GN3 companies in Malaysia. The results emphasis the need for heightened awareness among top management, particularly the board of directors, to improve the performance of these distressed companies. These insights could inform policymakers in designing effective policies to help companies survive COVID-19-related challenges and develop strategies to mitigate the effects of potential future crises.","Materials Science (all), Media Technology, Marketing","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

This research employs bibliometric analysis using the VOSviewer tool to examine and visually represent the progression of paradiplomacy research in the Scopus database. Within the Scopus database, a total of 214 documents from the years 1984 to 2023 were found that specifically mentioned paradiplomacy. Canada has the most contributors who discuss paradiplomacy, with precisely 34 papers. Most articles on paradiplomacy, specifically 68.0%, focus on the social sciences. Simultaneously, Stéphane Paquin holds the record for the highest number of documents authored, totaling ten. From 1984 to 2023, researchers in the field of paradiplomacy focused on 15 topics. These topics included subnational government, United States, diplomacy, diplomatic relations, cultural paradiplomacy, free trade, European Union, Quebec, decentralization, developing countries, federalism, assemblage theory, foreign relations, foreign policy, and sub-state diplomacy. Regarding the advancement of paradiplomacy research, several factors contribute to its development. These factors include the implementation of decentralization in various countries and the growing recognition among sub-state actors of the benefits they can achieve through paradiplomacy activities. This study concludes that between 1984 and 2023, the research on paradiplomacy primarily examined the interests of sub-state actor entities and their paradiplomacy activities. This is evident in the 15 topics that received significant attention from paradiplomacy researchers during this period.","Management Information Systems, Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty, Library and Information Sciences, Information Systems and Management","Universitas Muhammadiyah Malang | Universiti Utara Malaysia","Malang | Sintok","Indonesia | Malaysia"

This study aims to investigate the factors influencing career advancement or the hindrances faced by women in the auditing profession in Malaysia. A survey was distributed among audit staff working at auditing firms (both Big 4 and non-Big 4). Our results suggest that women accountants in Malaysia are indifferent about the glass ceiling compared to men, possibly due to increased gender diversity in the profession, government initiatives, policies, and cultural and social norms toward education. Instead, the study finds that structural bias and organizational culture bias are associated with a higher perception of the glass ceiling. Furthermore, employment at a Big 4 accounting firm is associated with a lower level of perceived glass ceiling, although this finding is only statistically significant at p < 0.10.

It further explores whether the potential impact of CSR performance on debt pricing is moderated by the females’ representation on board and female directors’ foreign experience. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a sample of 845 firm-year observations from 2017 to 2021 and apply various regression techniques, including the pooled ordinary least squares (POLS), the Heckman two-stage self-selection model, propensity score matching (PSM) and quantile regression, to test the study’s hypotheses. Findings: The results show that socially responsible firms incur lower costs of debt. Similarly, female directors and female directors with foreign exposure are negatively associated with CODF. However, their impact becomes positive when these two variables are interacted with CSR performance. The study findings are robust across alternative measures of board gender diversity, different model specifications and approaches addressing the endogeneity problem. In additional analyses, we find that the positive implication of CSR on CODF is more pronounced for firms with higher CSR performance and less financial constraint. Nevertheless, the results reveal that only firms with lower CSR performance but a high proportion of female directors and female directors with foreign experience exhibit lower CODF. This underscores the likelihood that female directors and their foreign exposure may substitute CSR practices in mitigating the cost of debt. Originality/value: Existing literature generally emphasises the importance of CSR performance to corporate financing decisions, often neglecting the role of female directors and their attributes in financial institutions’ creditworthiness evaluation. This study is among the first to address this gap by examining the moderating effect of female directors and their characteristics on CSR–CODF relationship within an emerging economy context. The findings contribute to the literature on CSR and board gender diversity, indicating that CSR performance and board gender diversity function more as substitutes than complements. Despite the unexpected consequences of interacting with female directors and their foreign experience with CSR, the study affirms the significance of CSR practices and board gender diversity in shaping borrowers’ financial decisions.","Accounting, Finance","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

A qualitative approach using thematic analysis of data from peer reviewed scholarly articles have been undertaken. Major findings emphasize on implementation of blended learning programs, professional learning communities and integration of ICT and artificial intelligence to enhance increased participation in MSPD programs. Teacher perceive MSPD as an effective tool to improve overall wellbeing and cognitive abilities in children, but are limited by lack of resources and enough training.

Using data from 30 provinces in China between 2010 and 2021, this study examines the impact of income and expenditure decentralization on corruption levels. The study employs statistical models to explore the relationships between fiscal decentralization and corruption, as well as the moderating effect of the ERA system. The analysis reveals that both income decentralization and expenditure decentralization are positively and significantly correlated with increased corruption levels. Notably, expenditure decentralization has a stronger and more pronounced effect on corruption compared to income decentralization. Additionally, the ERA system does not moderate or reduce the positive relationship between fiscal decentralization and corruption. The findings suggest that the ERA system is limited in its capacity to curb corruption in the context of fiscal decentralization. Despite the audit system’s implementation, it does not appear to effectively address the link between decentralization and corruption, particularly regarding expenditure decentralization. These results provide critical insights for policymakers and governance officials, indicating the need for stronger and more targeted anti-corruption strategies. The study suggests reconsidering the effectiveness of the ERA and exploring complementary mechanisms to reduce corruption in the decentralized fiscal system.","Multidisciplinary","College of Business, Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Coordinated and executed. This study focuses on domain knowledge management of the Malaysian construction industry. Thirty-one respondents from various categories of construction organizations have participated in this concurrent mixed-method study. A purposive sampling procedure has been used to obtain the required data. Before that, an instrument was prepared, consisting of measurement on four constructs, namely Perception about Organization Environment (POE), Perception about Knowledge Management in Organization (PKO), Knowledge Discovery Practices (KDP), and Appreciation System (AP). Since the ordinal scale was used, the qualitative descriptive analysis was done based on median, maximum, and minimum values. Additionally, a Spearman Correlation analysis was conducted, revealing several significant correlations, including those between PEO and KMO, PEO and KDP, KMO and KDP, KMO and AP, as well as KDP and AP. During the survey, suggestions from the respondents regarding the best practices for knowledge management were also sought. This qualitative data was later analyzed using thematic analysis. As a result, it is revealed that most of the sampled construction organizations provide encouraging environments for good knowledge management practices. They support knowledge discovery and acquisition while implementing an appreciation system to maintain the good practice of knowledge management. The thematic analysis has also indicated that knowledge management applications are crucial for these organizations. Overall, this study has expanded the existing body of knowledge by providing insights into implementing scalable and sustainable knowledge management practices tailored for construction organizations.","Multidisciplinary","Universiti Utara Malaysia","Sintok","Malaysia"

Despite some attempted review studies, relatively few have targeted ASR in an EFL setting. Therefore, the current study aims to delve into various aspects of ASR implementation, including theoretical foundations, research topics, research methods, target features, measurements, and findings, drawing upon published empirical literature. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guided the review. Of the 6138 articles with 2886 from Web of Science Core Collection and 3252 from Scopus, a total of 24 empirical articles were included. The results revealed: (1) twenty percent of the studies consisted of underpinning theories/models/concepts for the implementation of ASR in an EFL context; (2) a majority of studies adopted a quasi-experimental design, primarily focusing on the pronunciation gains in accuracy; (3) most learning activities with the use of ASR tools were designed for in-class activities; (4) the reviewed ASR studies were primarily concerned with the production accuracy of segmental features. Based on the findings, ASR is proven to be an effective tool in language classrooms but entails limitations. Future studies should investigate how ASR can best be implemented in a classroom setting.","N/A","Shandong Women’s University | Universiti Utara Malaysia","Jinan | Sintok","China | Malaysia"
